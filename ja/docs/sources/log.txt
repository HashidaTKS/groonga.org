Log

Groonga has two log files. They are process log and query
log. Process log is for all of :doc:`executables/groonga`
works. Query log is just for query processing.

Process log is enabled by default. Log path can be
customized by :option:`--log-path` option.  Each log has its
log level. If a log is smaller than groonga process' log
level, it's not logged. Log level can be customized by
:option:`-l` or :doc:`commands/log_level`.
