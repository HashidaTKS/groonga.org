How to report a bug
===================

We have two issue tracking systems,
Redmine_ and `GitHub issue tracker`_. Redmine is for
Japanese and GitHub issue tracker is for English. You can
use both of them to report a bug.

.. _Redmine: http://redmine.groonga.org/projects/groonga/
.. _GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/groonga/groonga/issues
