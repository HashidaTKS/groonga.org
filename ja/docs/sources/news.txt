  ``array<object>`` style weight vector column. The example of
  ``array<object>`` style is: ``[{"key1": weight1}, {"key2":
  weight2}]``.

* Supported to search ``!(XXX OPERATOR VALUE)`` by index. Supported
  operator is not only ``>`` but also ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``==``
  and ``!=``.

  ``drilldown`` evaluation.

  usage. It's enabled when the number of max threads is 0.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] ``columns[LABEL](N)`` is used
  for query log format instead of ``columns(N)[LABEL]``..

* [:doc:`/tutorial/query_expansion`] Updated example to use vector
  column because it is recommended way. [Reported by Gurunavi, Inc]

* Supported to detect canceled request while locking. It fixes the
  problem that ``request_cancel`` is ignored unexpectedly while locking.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Supported ``initial``
  and ``filtered`` stage dynamic columns. The examples are:
  ``--columns[LABEL].stage initial`` or ``--columns[LABEL].stage
  filtered``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Supported
  ``match_columns``, ``query`` and ``drilldown_filter`` option.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/highlight_html`] Supported similar
  search.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Supported ``initial`` 
  and stage dynamic columns in labeled drilldown. The example is: 
  ``--drilldowns[LABEL].stage initial``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Supported window
  function in dynamic column.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Added documentation about
  dynamic columns.

* [:doc:`/reference/window_function`] Added section about window
  functions.

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] Dropped CentOS 5 support because of EOL.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.11.12

* Supported to disable AND match optimization by environment variable.
  You can disable this feature by

  by default.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/vector_new`] Added a new function to
  create a new vector.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Added documentation about
  ``drilldown_filter``.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/lock_clear`] Fixed a crash bug against
  temporary database.

* Fixed a problem that dynamically updated index size was increased
  for natural language since Grooonga 6.1.4.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Fixed a bug that "A && B.C @ X"
  may not return records that should be matched.

* Fixed a conflict with ``grn_io_flush()`` and
  ``grn_io_expire()``. Without this change, if ``io_flush`` and ``load``
  command are executed simultaneously in specific timing, it causes a
  crash bug by access violation.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_table_remove`] Fixed a crash bug
  when the max number of threads is 1.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/in_values`] Supported sequential search
  for reference vector column. [Patch by Naoya Murakami] [GitHub#629]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Changed to report error instead
  of ignoring on invalid ``drilldown[LABEL].sort_keys``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Removed needless metadata
  updates on DB. It reduces the case that database lock remains

  by lock_clear against DB.

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] Enabled EPEL by default to install Groonga
  on Amazon Linux.

  syntax for prefix("@^"), suffix("@$"), regexp("@^") search.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/query`] Added documentation about
  available list of mode. The default mode is ``MATCH`` ("@") mode
  which executes full text search.

* [rpm][centos] Supported groonga-token-filter-stem package which
  provides stemming feature by ``TokenFilterStem`` token filter on
  CentOS 7. [GitHub#633] [Reported by Tim Bellefleur]

* [:doc:`/reference/window_functions/window_record_number`] Marked
  ``record_number`` as deprecated. Use ``window_record_number``
  instead. ``record_number`` is still available for backward
  compatibility.

* [:doc:`/reference/window_functions/window_sum`] Added ``window_sum``
  window function. It's similar behavior to window function sum() on
  PostgreSQL.

* Supported to construct offline indexing with in-memory (temporary)
  ``TABLE_DAT_KEY`` table. [GitHub#623] [Reported by Naoya Murakami]

* [onigmo] Updated bundled Onigmo to 6.1.1.

* Supported ``columns[LABEL].window.group_keys``. It's used to apply
  window function for every group.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Supported to report error on
  invalid key. It enables you to detect mismatch type of key.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Supported ``--output_errors yes``
  option. If you specify "yes", you can get errors for each load
  failed record. Note that this feature requires command version 3.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Improve error message on table key
  cast failure. Instead of "cast failed", type of table key and target
  type of table key are also contained in error message.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.11.9.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug that nonexistent sort keys for ``drilldowns[LABEL]`` or
  ``slices[LABEL]`` causes invalid JSON parse error. [Patch by Naoya
  Murakami] [GitHub#627]

* Fixed a bug that access to nonexistent sub records for group causes
  a crash.  For example, This bug affects the case when you use
  ``drilldowns[LABEL].sort_keys _sum`` without specifying
  ``calc_types``.  [Patch by Naoya Murakami] [GitHub#625]

* Fixed a crash bug when tokenizer has an error. It's caused when
  tokenizer and token filter are registered and tokenizer has an
  error.

  bug that arguments for window function is not correctly
  passed. [GitHub#634][Patch by Naoya Murakami]
