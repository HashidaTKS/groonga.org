* Limitations

** Limits about index

In one index, logical limits in Senna are below.

-max record count : 268,435,455
-max lexicon count : 268,435,455
-max index size : 256GByte

(Actually, other conditions may interfere for Senna to attain these limits.)

** use in multi-process/multi-thread

You cannot 'update' one index at a time in multi-process/multi-thread environments.
If you do so, you have to update with exclusive access control.

** About SEN_SPLIT_ALPHA,DIGIT,SYMBOL

SEN_SPLIT_ALPHA,DIGIT,SYMBOL options have no effect in absense of SEN_INDEX_NORLALIZE.

** About sen_records_find, sen_records_at

You cannot get valid results with sen_records_next 
after you use sen_records_find or sen_records_at.
You have to execute sen_records_rewind and initialize the cursor.

** About opentag and closetag in snippet API

If you use snippet functions,
you cannot modify data in a buffer which is passed as opentag or closetag 
before you call sen_snip_close.

** About sen_sel_partial option, sen_sym_suffix_search

In below case, 
you cannot execute 'suffix' search in searching with sen_sel_search or sen_sym_suffix_search.

-alphabet, number, symbol in euc-jp/sjis/utf-8 text
-index is created with SEN_INDEX_DELIMTED option.

Because, English words generally vary in it's suffix but prefix.

** Indexes in Windows and Linux are different.

* Bugs

** Now, you cannot use Senna with AIO/DIO.

Senna has a user level cache with AIO/DIO which is implemented in Linux 2.6.
But, this feature is not stable. Segmentation fault may occur.
