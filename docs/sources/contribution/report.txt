How to report a bug
===================

We have two issue tracking systems, `Redmine
<http://redmine.groonga.org/projects/groonga/issues>`_ and
`GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/groonga/groonga/issues>`_.
Redmine is for Japanese and GitHub issue tracker is for
English. You can use both of them to report a bug.
