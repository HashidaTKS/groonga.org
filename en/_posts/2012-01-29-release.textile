h3. Rename commands are added

table_rename and column_rename commands are added. They can
rename table name and column name.
Here are usages:

table_rename:

<pre>
> table_rename ${table_name} ${new_table_name}
</pre>

The following example renames Users table to People table:

<pre>
> table_rename Users People
</pre>

column_rename:

<pre>
> column_rename ${table_name} ${column_name} ${new_column_name}
</pre>

The following example renames name column of Users table to
nick column:

<pre>
> column_rename Users name nick
</pre>

Now, we are easy to try variable schema. :-)
