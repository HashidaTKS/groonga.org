Droonga 0.9.9 has been released
-------------------------------

Today we've released [Droonga
0.9.9](http://droonga.org/news/2014/02/09/release.html) .

Droonga is a scalable data processing engine, based on a stream oriented
processing model. The name is originated from "Distributed Groonga".
Yes, it is built on top of Groonga. In many operations (searching,
updating, grouping, and so on), Droonga processes various data by
pipeline. As the result, Droonga has large potential around its
flexibility and extensibility. Moreover, those features provide high
availability for people who develop any data processing engine based on
Droonga. You can process complex operations by mixing operations, and
you can add custom operations to Droonga via plugins written as
Ruby-scripts.

Now Droonga is under active development. Please try Droonga and join us
to accelerate the development!
