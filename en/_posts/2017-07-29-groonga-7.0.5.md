[Groonga 7.0.5](/docs/news.html#release-7-0-5) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * [dump] `--sort_hash_table` option has been supported
  * math_abs() function has been supported
  * Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support has been dropped

#### [dump] `--sort_hash_table` option has been supported

In this release, dump command supported `--sort_hash_table` option.

If this option is specified as `--sort_hash_table yes`, dump command shows result sorted by `_key`.

It is useful to check difference about dumped results of hash table.

#### math_abs() function has been supported

In this release, math_abs() function was supported. This function is used to calculate absolute value.

Register math plugin to use this function.

    plugin_register functions/math

Here is the sample schema and data:

    table_create City TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
    column_create City utc COLUMN_SCALAR Int32
  
    load --table City
    [
    {"_key": "Tokyo",    "utc": 9},
    {"_key": "New York", "utc": -4}, 
    {"_key": "Paris",    "utc": 2}
    ]
  
Let's search near city from Singapore. In this context, near means
that the value of time difference is smaller one.

You can search it by the following query:

    select City \
      --filter true \
      --output_columns '_key, utc, _score' \
      --scorer '_score = math_abs(8 - utc)' \
      --sort_keys _score

#### Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support has been dropped

In this release, Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support was dropped. It has reached EOL on July 20, 2017.
