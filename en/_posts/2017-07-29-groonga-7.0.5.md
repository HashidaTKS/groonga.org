[Groonga 7.0.5](/docs/news.html#release-7-0-5) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * [dump] Supported `--sort_hash_table` option
  * Supported math_abs() function
  * Dropped Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support

#### [dump] Supported `--sort_hash_table` option

In this release, dump command supported `--sort_hash_table` option.

If this option is specified as `--sort_hash_table yes`, dump command shows sorted result by `_key`.

It is useful to check difference about dumped results of hash table.

#### Supported math_abs() function

In this release, math_abs() function was supported. This function is used to calculate absolute value.

Register math plugin to use this function.

    plugin_register functions/math

Here is the sample schema and data:

    table_create Shops TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText 
    column_create Shops from_station COLUMN_SCALAR Int32

    load --table Shops
    [
    {"_key": "Coffee Shop",         "from_station":  50},
    {"_key": "Donut & Coffee Shop", "from_station": 400},
    {"_key": "Cake & Coffee Shop",  "from_station": 200}
    ]

Let's search nearest shops from office. assume that office is 250m from station.

You can search it by the following query:

    select Shops \
      --filter true \
      --output_columns '_key, from_office' \
      --scorer '_score = math_abs(250 - from_station)' \
      --sort_keys _score

#### Dropped Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support

In this release, Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support was dropped. It has reached EOL at July 20, 2017.
