## Groonga 4.0.6 has been released

[Groonga 4.0.6](/docs/news.html#release-4-0-6) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

In this release, main changes are small improvements and fixes.

One of new improvements is adding more validations to [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html) for creating an index column. In the earlier versions, you may create an incomplete index column. In this release, you can't create an incomplete index column. So you can find a problem as soon as possible.

Here are fixed problems:

  * Token ID is used instead of IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) in [similar search](/docs/reference/grn_expr/script_syntax.html#similar-search).
  * Removing a record for table that `_key` is indexed by multiple index columns causes a crash.
  * Full-text search by `*` treated as prefix search by an empty string.

Here are other improvements:

  * Users can specify the number of tokens used in similar search.
  * Groonga supports optimization of range search query such as `X > 0 && X <= 100` with mruby enabled build.

### For Heroku users
