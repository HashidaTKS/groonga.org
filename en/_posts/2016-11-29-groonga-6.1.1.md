## Groonga 6.1.1 has been released!

[Groonga 6.1.1](/docs/news.html#release-6-1-1) has been released!

How to install in each environment: [Install](/docs/install.html)

In this release, documents about index columns has been added. Using this column type makes reducing memory usage.

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* Supported column value compression with Zstandard
* Changed to stop compressing small data

#### Supported column value compression with Zstandard

In this release, additional compression algorithm is supported - [Zstandard](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/).

Then, you can use it by adding ``COMPRESS_ZSTD`` flag to column_create:

    column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR|COMPRESS_ZSTD Text

Above command creates ``content`` column in ``Memo`` table which supports column value compression with Zstandard.

#### Changed to stop compressing small data

If column data is less than 256 byte, the data aren't compressed even when `COMPRESS_ZLIB` or `COMPRESS_LZ4` or `COMPRESS_ZSTD` is specified.

It's for performance and space efficiency. Compressed data may be bigger than the original data for small data. If compression is meaningless, CPU power for compression is also meaningless.

### Conclusions

Please refer to [Release 6.1.1 - 2016-11-29](/docs/news.html#release-6-1-1) about detailed changes since 6.1.0.

Then, let's go all out to search by Groonga!
