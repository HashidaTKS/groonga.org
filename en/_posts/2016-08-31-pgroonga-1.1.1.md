## PGroonga 1.1.1 has been released

[PGroonga](httsp://pgroonga.github.io/) (píːzí:lúnɡά) 1.1.1 has been released!

See [PGroonga 1.0.0 release announce]({% post_url 2015-10-29-pgroonga-1.0.0 %}) about PGroonga.

## Changes

Here are changes since 1.0.9:

  * [Windows] Upgraded bundled Groonga to 6.0.8.
  * Improved the number of hits estimation. It helps that planner choose suitable index use or not index use. Therefore, total performance is improved.
  * Added [`pgroonga.match_positions_character`](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-match-positions-character.html) function that returns match positions in character.
  * Added [`pgroonga.flush`](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-flush.html) function that flushes buffered changes in memory.
  * Fixed a bug that needless recheck is ran on bitmap heap scan. If recheck is ran, performance is down.

In this release, performance is improved. Earlier PGroonga releases are fast but you can get more performance improvement by just upgrading to this release. Let's try PGroonga!

## How to upgrade

This version is compatible with 1.0.9 and 1.1.0. Upgrade by steps in ["Compatible case" in Upgrade document](https://pgroonga.github.io/upgrade/#compatible-case).

## Group chat that supports full text search by PGroonga

Do you know [Zulip](https://zulip.org/)? It's an open source group chat. It's [open source-ed by Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/).

Zulip supports full text search but it only supports English. Zulip now [supports PGroonga based full text search feature](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/700). It supports all languages.

Zulip doesn't release a new version that includes PGroonga support. But [you can start using Zulip](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-install.html). [You can upgrade](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading) after installing Zulip.

## Conclusion

New PGroonga version has been released.

Try PGroonga when you want to perform fast full text search against all languages on PostgreSQL!
