## Groonga 7.0.9 has been released

[Groonga 7.0.9](/docs/news.html#release-7.0.9) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * More than 126 arguments has been supported in [in_values](/docs/reference/functions/in_values.html) function
  * The documentation about dynamic columns has been added for [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters) and [logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters)

### More than 126 arguments has been supported in [in_values](/docs/reference/functions/in_values.html) function

In the previous version, there is a limitation about the max number of arguments in [in_values](/docs/reference/functions/in_values.html).

This fact disturbs you to simplify the query by `in_values` which uses too many `OR` and `==` in a query.

In this release, this limitation about the max number of arguments is removed.

### The documentation about dynamic columns has been added for [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters) and [logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters)

Not only [select](/ja/docs/reference/commands/select.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters) and [logical_select](/ja/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html#dynamic-column-related-parameters) commands, but also `logical_range_filter` and `logical_count` command, dynamic columns has been supported.

`logical_range_filter` command is fast in contrast to `logical_select` command if many records are matched and requested records are small enough.

### Conclusion

See [Release 7.0.9 2017-11-29](/docs/news.html#release-7.0.9) about detailed changes since 7.0.8
