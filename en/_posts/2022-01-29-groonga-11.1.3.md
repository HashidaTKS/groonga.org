### Improvements

* [snippet](/docs/reference/functions/snippet.html) Added support for using the keyword of 32 or more.

  We could not specify the keyword of 32 or more with ``snippet`` until now.
  However, we can specify the keyword of 32 or more by this improvement as below.

  ```
  table_create Entries TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Entries content COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  load --table Entries

  {"content": "Groonga is a fast and accurate full text search engine based on inverted index. One of the characteristics of Groonga is that a newly registered document instantly appears in search results. Also, Groonga allows updates without read locks. These characteristics result in superior performance on real-time applications.\nGroonga is also a column-oriented database management system (DBMS). Compared with well-known row-oriented systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, column-oriented systems are more suited for aggregate queries. Due to this advantage, Groonga can cover weakness of row-oriented systems.\nThe basic functions of Groonga are provided in a C library. Also, libraries for using Groonga in other languages, such as Ruby, are provided by related projects. In addition, groonga-based storage engines are provided for MySQL and PostgreSQL. These libraries and storage engines allow any application to use Groonga. See usage examples."},
  {"content": "In widely used DBMSs, updates are immediately processed, for example, a newly registered record appears in the result of the next query. In contrast, some full text search engines do not support instant updates, because it is difficult to dynamically update inverted indexes, the underlying data structure.\nGroonga also uses inverted indexes but supports instant updates. In addition, Groonga allows you to search documents even when updating the document collection. Due to these superior characteristics, Groonga is very flexible as a full text search engine. Also, Groonga always shows good performance because it divides a large task, inverted index merging, into smaller tasks."}

* [NormalizerNFKC130](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_nfkc130.html) Added a new option remove_symbol.

  This option removes symbols (e.g. #, !, “, &, %, …) from the string that the target of normalizing as below.

  ```
  normalize   'NormalizerNFKC130("remove_symbol", true)'   "#This & is %% a pen."   WITH_TYPES

  ```

* [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for AlmaLinux 8 on ARM64.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.21.5.

* [Documentation] Fixed a typo in [ruby_eval](/docs/reference/commands/ruby_eval.html).

* [Ubuntu](/docs/install/ubuntu.html) Dropped Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) support.

  Because Ubuntu 21.04 reached EOL January 20, 2022.

### Fixes

* [load](/docs//reference/commands/load.html) Fixed a crash bug when we load data with specifying a nonexistent column.

  This bug only occurs when we specify ``apache-arrow`` into ``input_type`` as the argument of ``load``.

* Fixed a bug that the version up of Groonga failed Because the version up of arrow-libs on which Groonga depends.

  However, if arrow-libs update a major version, this problem reproduces.
  In this case, we will handle that by rebuilding the Groonga package.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.

### Conclusion
