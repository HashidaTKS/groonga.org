### Rename commands are added

table_rename and column_rename commands are added. They can rename table name and column name.
Here are usages:

table_rename:

    > table_rename ${table_name} ${new_table_name}

The following example renames Users table to People table:

    > table_rename Users People

column_rename:

    > column_rename ${table_name} ${column_name} ${new_column_name}

The following example renames name column of Users table to nick column:

    > column_rename Users name nick

Now, we are easy to try variable schema. :-)
