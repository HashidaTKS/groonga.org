Fixed fixed index search bug that missing search results even though it should be matched. It may occur in Groonga 6.0.3 or later.

We recommend you to upgrade to 6.0.9 if you use Groonga 6.0.3 or later.

If you can't immediately upgrade, you can avoid the bug by the following environment variable:

    GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE=no

#### Supported regular expression in location directive for groonga-httpd

You can now use regular expression in location directive in configuration file of groonga-httpd.

    location ~ ^/d/(load|delete) {
      groonga on;
      groonga_base_path /d/;

      # Settings for the host
    }
