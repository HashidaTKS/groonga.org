h2. Droonga 1.0.2 has been released

Today we've released "Droonga 1.0.2":http://droonga.org/news/2014/04/29/release.html .

Droonga is a scalable data processing engine, based on a stream oriented processing model. The name is originated from "Distributed Groonga".

Good news! Droonga 1.0.2 has better compatibility to Groonga. Some basic commands including "load" are now available. Moreover there is a new "tutorial for Groonga users":http://droonga.org/tutorial/groonga/ aiming to migrate from Groonga to Droonga. Droonga is still under development, but it already can work as a Groonga with the replication feature, via HTTP. Feel free to try it on!

Now Droonga is under active development. Please try Droonga and join us to accelerate the development!
