#### New options for the TokenMecab tokenizer

[TokenMecab](/docs/reference/tokenizers#tokenmecab) now accepts these new options:

 * `include_class`: outputs MeCab's metadata `class` and `subclass`.
 * `include_reading`: outputs MeCab's metadata `reading`.
 * `include_form`: outputs MeCab's metadata `inflected_type`, `inflected_form`, and `base_form`.
 * `use_reading`: allows to search terms by corresponding reading written in kana.
   This option will help you to search orthographical variants by kana.

For more details, see the [reference](/docs/reference/tokenizers#tokenmecab).

#### New options for the TokenNgram tokenizer

[TokenNgram](/docs/reference/tokenizers#tokenngram) now accepts these new options:

 * `unify_alphabet`: `TokenNgram("unify_alphabet", false)` will work same as `TokenBigramSplitAlpha`.
 * `unify_symbol`: `TokenNgram("unify_symbol", false)` will work same as `TokenBigramSplitSymbol`.
 * `unify_digit`: `TokenNgram("unify_digit", false)` will work same as `TokenBigramSplitDigit`.

For more details, see the [reference](/docs/reference/tokenizers#tokenngram).

#### Groonga now can grab plugins from multiple directories

A new environent variable `GRN_PLUGINS_PATH` is available to detect plugins from multiple directories.
It is a list of path to directories, separated with `;` (on Windows) or `:` (on other platforms).

`GRN_PLUGINS_PATH` has priority higher than the existing `GRN_PLUGINS_DIR`.

Note that this does not work on Windows currently.
