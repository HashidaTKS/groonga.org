## Droonga 1.1.0 has been released

Today we've released [Droonga 1.1.0](http://droonga.org/news/2015/04/29/release.html).

Droonga is a distributed full text search engine, compatible to Groonga.
The name is originated from "Distributed Groonga".

The most important topic on this release is *true hot-add of replica nodes*.
It was one of long-planned features of Droonga, but we've got it.
Now you can add new replica nodes to your Droonga cluster without any downtime, even if you don't stop crawling/adding new data!

Now Droonga is under development continuously.
Please try Droonga and join us to accelerate the development!
