[Groonga 7.0.7](/docs/news.html#release-7-0-7) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * Fixed the case that `--query '+'` doesn't work for `QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR` flag
  * `--default-command-version 3` has been supported
  * Caching select result with function call has been supported.
  
### Fixed the case that `--query '+'` doesn't work for `QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR` flag

In the previous version, `QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR` flag is introduced. If this flag is set, query never causes syntax error.

But there is a case that it causes an error when this flag is used for `--query '+'`. In this release, this bug was fixed.

### `--default-command-version 3` has been supported

In this release, groonga executable now supports `--default-command-version 3`. In the previous versions, groonga executable only supports `--command_version 3` but not for `--default-command-version 3`.

### Caching select result with function call has been supported.

In this release, caching select result with function call feature has been supported.

Now, most of existing functions supports this feature.

But there are two exception. When `now()` and `rand()` are used in a query, select result will not be cached.

### Conclusion
