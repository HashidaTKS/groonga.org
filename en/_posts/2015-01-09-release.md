## Groonga 4.1.0 has been released

[Groonga 4.1.0](/docs/news.html#release-4-1-0) has been released. It's
a bug fix release of Groonga 4.0.9. Groonga 4.0.9 has a serious bug
that may break index.

If you have already upgraded to 4.0.9, please upgrade to 4.1.0. And
re-create your all indexes. You can re-create your indexes by removing
and re-creating your indexes such as:

    column_remove TABLE INDEX_COLUMN
    column_create TABLE INDEX_COLUMN COLUMN_INDEX|...

See the following documents how to use these commands:

  * [column_remove](/docs/reference/commands/column_remove.html)
  * [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html)

If you didn't change your indexes by Groonga 4.0.9, you don't need to
re-create your indexes. "change" means "add", "remove" and
"update". If you use your indexes only for "search" by Groonga 4.0.9,
you don't need to re-create your indexes.

If you know more information or have any question, please ask it on
[the mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/p/groonga/mailman/groonga-talk/)
or [@groonga](https://twitter.com/groonga). We'll answer it.

We're sorry for your inconvenient. 4.0.9 users, please upgrade your Groonga.
