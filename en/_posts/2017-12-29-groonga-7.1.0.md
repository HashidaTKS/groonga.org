```text
2017-12-29 15:23:47.049299|0x7ffe8af29a50|:000000001209848 load(3): [1][2][3]

```text
2017-12-29 15:19:53.703472|0x7ffe0ce4e650|:000000001372833 filter(1)
2017-12-29 15:19:53.703499|0x7ffe0ce4e650|:000000001397623 select(1)[Logs_20170315]

2017-12-29 15:19:53.704024|0x7ffe0ce4e650|:000000001923225 filter(2)
2017-12-29 15:19:53.704040|0x7ffe0ce4e650|:000000001937931 select(2)[Logs_20170317]

```

The number in () of after the select is number of matched records or result of plain drilldown, result of labeled drilldown.
These number's meaning is differernt by executed query.
These numbers is displayed each shard.
The above example have three shard. So, Three selects are displyed.
At the trailing [], the table name searched is displayed.

### [delete](/docs/reference/commands/delete.html)Improved the `delete`'s query-log format.

Added detail below items in the `delete`'s query-log.

  * outputs number of deleted and error records.
  * outputs number of rest number of records.

The number in () of after the delete is number of deleted records.
The number in first [] is number of error records.
The number in second [] is rest number of records.

### Supported vector for drilldown calc target

You can drilldown against vector columns.
As below, you can specify vecotr column in `drilldown_calc_target`. So, you can get min and max and sum, average with elements of vector columns.

```text
table_create Tags TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

table_create Memos TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
column_create Memos tag COLUMN_SCALAR Tags
column_create Memos scores COLUMN_VECTOR Int64

load --table Memos
[
{"_key": "Groonga1", "tag": "Groonga", "scores": [10, 29]},
{"_key": "Groonga2", "tag": "Groonga", "scores": [20]},
{"_key": "Groonga3", "tag": "Groonga", "scores": [60, 71]},
{"_key": "Mroonga1", "tag": "Mroonga", "scores": [61, 62, 63]},
{"_key": "Mroonga2", "tag": "Mroonga", "scores": [24, 20, 16]},
{"_key": "Mroonga3", "tag": "Mroonga", "scores": [8, 5, 2]},
{"_key": "Rroonga1", "tag": "Rroonga", "scores": [3]},
{"_key": "Rroonga2", "tag": "Rroonga", "scores": [-9, 0, 9]},
{"_key": "Rroonga3", "tag": "Rroonga", "scores": [0]}
]
```

When you execute below query against the above table, you can get min and max and sum, average in the below groups.

  * Group with Groonga in tag.
  * Group with Mroonga in tag.
  * Group with Rroonga in tag.

```text
select Memos \
  --limit 0 \
  --drilldowns[tag].keys tag \
  --drilldowns[tag].calc_types 'MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG' \
  --drilldowns[tag].calc_target scores \
  --drilldowns[tag].output_columns _key,_max,_min,_sum,_avg
```

It is the value of `_key`, `_max`, `_min`, `_sum`, `_avg` from left.

```text
["Groonga", 71, 10, 190, 38.0],
["Mroonga", 63, 2, 261, 29.0],
["Rroonga", 9, -1, 3, 0.6],
```

### [bulk] Reduced the number of `realloc()`

It improves performance for large output case on Windows.
For example, it causes 100x faster for 100MB over output.

### Added new function `index_column_source_records`

As below, this function gets source records of index column.

```text
plugin_register functions/index_column

table_create Memos TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText

table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
  --default_tokenizer TokenBigram \
  --normalizer NormalizerAuto
column_create Terms index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Memos _key

load --table Memos
[
{"_key": "Groonga is a fast full text search engine."},
{"_key": "Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine based on Groonga."},
{"_key": "Rroonga is a Ruby bindings for Groonga."}
]
```

When you execute query in the below against the above table, you can get record which has token in registered in the `Terms` table.

```
select Terms \
  --limit -1 \
  --sort_keys _id \
  --columns[index_records].stage output \
  --columns[index_records].type Memos \
  --columns[index_records].flags COLUMN_VECTOR \
  --columns[index_records].value 'index_column_source_records("index")' \
  --output_columns '_id, _key, index_records'
```

The rightmost value is the result of `index_column_source_records`.

```text
[ 1, "groonga", [ "Groonga is a fast full text search engine.", "Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine based on Groonga.", "Rroonga is a Ruby bindings for Groonga." ] ],
[ 2, "is", [ "Groonga is a fast full text search engine.", "Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine based on Groonga.", "Rroonga is a Ruby bindings for Groonga." ] ],
(Abbreviation)
```
