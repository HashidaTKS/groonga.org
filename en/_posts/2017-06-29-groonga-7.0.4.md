## Groonga 7.0.4 has been released

[Groonga 7.0.4](/docs/news.html#release-7-0-4) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * Supported Debian 9 (stretch)
  * Added [grndb](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) log options
  * Improved query performance

#### Supported Debian 9 (stretch)

In this release, Debian 9 (stretch) has been supported!

Now install documentation is out for [Debian 9 (stretch)](/docs/install/debian.html#stretch) users.

#### Added [grndb](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) log options

In this release, log options are supported for [grndb](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html).

`grndb` is a tool for maintenance Groonga database. It provides [grndb check](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html#check) and [grndb recover](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html#recover). But in the previous versions, `grndb` doesn't support logging options.

Use supported `--log-level` and `--log-path` option to save `grndb` logs.

#### Improved query performance

In this release, some query performance is improved.
Here are some improved patterns.

* `FIXED_SIZED_COLUMN OPERATOR CONSTANT` 

  * Improved performance by reducing redundant process when accessing column data. Supported operators are `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`.

* `in_records()`

  * Improved performance by reducing too many object creation. To avoid such a situation, implementation is switched from mruby to C.


### Conclusion
