## Groonga 10.0.4 has been released

[Groonga 10.0.4](/docs/news.html#release-10-0-4) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* Added support for registering 400M records into a hash table.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improve scorer performance when the ``_score`` doesn't get recursively values.

  * Groonga get recursively value of ``_score`` when search result is search target.
  * For example, the search targets of ``slices`` are search result. Therefore, if we use ``slice`` in a query, this improvement doesn't ineffective.

* [log](/docs/reference/log.html) Improved that we output drilldown keys in query-log.

* [reference_acquire](/docs/reference/commands/reference_acquire.html), [reference_release](/docs/reference/commands/reference_release.html) Added new commands for reference count mode.

  * If we need to call multiple ``load`` in a short time, auto close by the reference count mode will degrade performance.
  * We can avoid the performance degrading by calling ``reference_acquire`` before multiple ``load`` and calling ``reference_release`` after multiple ``load``.
    Between ``reference_acquire`` and ``reference_release``, auto close is disabled.

    * Because ``reference_acquire`` acquires a reference of target objects.

  * We can must call ``reference_release`` after you finish performance impact operations.
  * If we don’t call ``reference_release``, the reference count mode doesn’t work.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for aggregating multiple groups on one time ``drilldown``.

* [groonga-executable-fille](/docs/reference/executables/groonga.html) Added support for ``--pid-path`` in standalone mode.

  * Because ``--pid-path`` had been ignored in standalone mode in before version.

* [io_flush](/docs/reference/commands/io_flush.html) Added support for reference count mode.

* [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html), [logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html) Added support for reference count mode.

* [groonga-server-http](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-server-http) We didn't add header after the last chunk.

  * Because there is a possibility to exist that the HTTP client ignores header after the last chunk.

* [vector_slice] Added support for a vector that has the value of the ``Float32`` type.

* Added support for parallel offline index construction using token column.

  * We came to be able to construct an offline index on parallel threads from data that are tokenized in advance.

  * We can tune parallel offline construction by the following environment variables

    * GRN_TOKEN_COLUMN_PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE: How many records are processed per thread.

      * The default value is ``1024`` records.

    * GRN_TOKEN_COLUMN_PARALLEL_TABLE_SIZE_THRESHOLD: How many source records are required for parallel offline construction.

      * The default value is ``102400`` records.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved performance for ``load_table`` on the reference count mode.

* Fixed a bug that the database of Groonga was broken when we search by using the dynamic columns that don't specify a ``--filter`` and stridden over shard.

* Fixed a bug that ``Float32`` type had not displayed on a result of ``schema`` command.

* Fixed a bug that we count in surplus to ``_nsubrecs`` when the reference ``uvector`` hasn't element.

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for aggregating multiple groups on one time ``drilldown``.

  * We came to be able to calculate sum or arithmetic mean every different multiple groups on one time ``drilldown`` as below.
