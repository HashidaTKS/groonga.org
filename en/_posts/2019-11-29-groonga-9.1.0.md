## Groonga 9.1.0 has been released

[Groonga 9.1.0](/docs/news.html#release-9-1-0) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * Improved the performance of the "&&" operation.

    * For example, the performance of condition expression such as the following is increased.

    * `( A || B ) && ( C || D ) && ( E || F) ...`

    * This optimization has an effect especially when a condition that hits many records and it that hits few records are mixing.

  * [TokenMecab](/docs/reference/tokenizers/token_mecab.html) Added a new option ``use_base_form``.

    * We can search using the base form of a token by this option.

    * For example, if we search "謾ｯ縺医ｋ" using this option, "謾ｯ縺医◆" is hit also.

  * Fix a bug that when the accessor is index, performance decreases.

    * For example, it occurs with the query include the following conditions.

      * `sccessor @ query`

      * `accessor == query`

  * Fixed a bug the estimated size of a search result was overflow when the buffer is big enough.

  * Added missing tools.

    * Because `index-column-diff-all.sh` and `object-inspect-all.sh` had not bundled in before version.
