h2. Droonga 0.7.0 has been released

Today we've released "Droonga 0.7.0":http://droonga.org/2013/11/29/release.html .
This is the first release of Droonga.


Droonga is a scalable data processing engine, built on top of Groonga.
It is based on a stream-oriented processing model, so it operates
data (for example, search, update, group, and so on) by pipeline.
The processing model makes Droonga flexible and extensible.
Droonga can also process complex operations by mixing operations.
Users can add custom operations to Droonga as Ruby plugins easily.

The version number of this release is 0.7.0. This means "usable" not "stable".
Now Droonga is under active development.
Please try Droonga and join us to accelerate the development!
