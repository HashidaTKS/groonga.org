### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [load] Supported to show `{"n_loaded_records": N}` in response
* [load] Supported `--output_ids yes` parameter

#### [load] Supported to show `{"n_loaded_records": N}` in response

In this release, `load` command supports to show how many records are loaded in response.

Here is the example which shows number of loaded records.

    {
      "header": {
        "return_code": 0,
        "start_time": 0.0,
        "elapsed_time": 0.0
      },
      "body": {
        "n_loaded_records": 2
      }
    }

It shows that 2 records are loaded.

Note that `n_loaded_records` is supported by command version 3 or later.

#### [load] Supported `--output_ids yes` parameter

In this release, `--output_ids yes` paremeter is supported.

If `--output_ids yes` is specified, loaded record IDs(loaded_ids) are also returned. ID is 0 for record that is failed to add.

    {
      "header": {
        "return_code": 0,
        "start_time": 0.0,
        "elapsed_time": 0.0
      },
      "body": {
        "n_loaded_records": 2,
        "loaded_ids": [
          1,
          0,
          2
        ]
      }
    }

Note that `--output_ids yes` parameter is supported by command version
3 or later and it is not recommended to use `--output_ids yes` when you loads large number of records in the point of view of performance.
