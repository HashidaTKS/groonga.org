h2. Droonga 1.0.0 has been released

Today we've released "Droonga 1.0.0":http://droonga.org/news/2014/02/28/release.html . This is the first major release.

Droonga is a scalable data processing engine, based on a stream oriented processing model. The name is originated from "Distributed Groonga". Yes, it is built on top of Groonga. In many operations (searching, updating, grouping, and so on), Droonga processes various data by pipeline. As the result, Droonga has large potential around its flexibility and extensibility. Moreover, those features provide high availability for people who develop any data processing engine based on Droonga. You can process complex operations by mixing operations, and you can add custom operations to Droonga via plugins written as Ruby-scripts.

Now Droonga is under active development. Please try Droonga and join us to accelerate the development!
