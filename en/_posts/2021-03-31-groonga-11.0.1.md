## Groonga 11.0.1 has been released

[Groonga 11.0.1](/docs/news.html#release-11-0-1) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [Debian GNU/Linux](/docs/install/debian.html) Added support for a ARM64 package.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for customizing adjust weight every key word.

  * We need to specify ``<`` or ``>`` to all keywords to adjust scores until now.
    Because the default adjustment of weight (6 or 4) is larger than the default score (1).

    * Therefore, for example, "A"'s weight is 1 and "B"'s weight is 4 in ``A <B``.
      Decremented "B"'s weight (4) is larger than not decremented "A"'s weight (1).
      This is not works as expected.
      we need to specify ``>A <B`` to use smaller weight than "A" for "B".
      "A"'s weight is 6 and "B"'s weight is 4 in ``>A <B``.

  * We can customize adjustment of weight every key word by only specifying ``<${WEIGHT}`` or ``>${WEIGHT}`` to target keywords since this release.
    For example, "A"'s weight is 1 and "B"'s weight is 0.9 in ``A <0.1B`` ("B"'s weight decrement 0.1).

  * However, note that these forms ( ``>${WEIGHT}...``, ``<${WEIGHT}...``, and ``~${WEIGHT}...`` ) are incompatible.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for outputting ``Float`` and ``Float32`` value in Apache Arrow format.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for getting a reference destination data via index column when we output a result.

  * Until now, Groonga had returned involuntary value when we specified output value like ``index_column.xxx``.
    For example, A value of ``--columns[tags].value purchases.tag`` was ``["apple",["many"]],["banana",["man"]],["cacao",["man"]]`` in the following example. In this case, the expected values was ``["apple",["man","many"]],["banana",["man"]],["cacao",["woman"]]``.
    In this release, we can get a correct reference destination data via index column as below.

      ```

            [

              [
                "man",
                "many"
              ]
            ],
            [
              "banana",
              [
                "man"
              ]
            ],
            [
              "cacao",

            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
      ```

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for specifying index column directly as a part of nested index.

  * We can search source table after filtering by using ``index_column.except_source_column``.
    For example, we specify ``comments.content`` when searching in the following example.
    In this case, at first, this query execute full text search from ``content`` column of ``Commentts`` table, then fetch the records of Articles table which refers to already searched records of Comments table.

       ```

             ]
           ]
         ]
       ]
       ```

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for loading reference vector from JSON text.

  * We can load data to reference vector from source table with JSON text as below.

      ```
      table_create Purchases TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
      column_create Purchases item COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
      column_create Purchases price COLUMN_SCALAR UInt32

      table_create Settlements TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
      column_create Settlements purchases COLUMN_VECTOR Purchases

      column_create Purchases settlements_purchases COLUMN_INDEX Settlements purchases

      load --table Settlements
      [
      {
        "_key": "super market",
        "purchases": "[{\"_key\": \"super market-1\", \"item\": \"apple\", \"price\": 100}, {\"_key\": \"super market-2\", \"item\": \"milk\",  \"price\": 200}]"
      },
      {
        "_key": "shoes shop",
        "purchases": "[{\"_key\": \"shoes shop-1\", \"item\": \"sneakers\", \"price\": 3000}]"
      }
      ]

      dump \
        --dump_plugins no \
        --dump_schema no
      load --table Purchases
      [
      ["_key","item","price"],
      ["super market-1","apple",100],
      ["super market-2","milk",200],
      ["shoes shop-1","sneakers",3000]
      ]

      load --table Settlements
      [
      ["_key","purchases"],
      ["super market",["super market-1","super market-2"]],
      ["shoes shop",["shoes shop-1"]]
      ]

      column_create Purchases settlements_purchases COLUMN_INDEX Settlements purchases
      ```

  * Currently, this feature doesn't support nested reference record.

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for loading reference vector with inline object literal.

  * For example, we can load data like ``"key" : "[ { "key" : "value", ..., "key" : "value" } ]"`` as below.

      ```
      table_create Purchases TABLE_NO_KEY
      column_create Purchases item COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
      column_create Purchases price COLUMN_SCALAR UInt32

      table_create Settlements TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
      column_create Settlements purchases COLUMN_VECTOR Purchases
      column_create Purchases settlements_purchases COLUMN_INDEX Settlements purchases

      load --table Settlements
      [
      {
        "_key": "super market",
        "purchases": [
           {"item": "apple", "price": 100},
           {"item": "milk",  "price": 200}
        ]
      },
      {
        "_key": "shoes shop",
        "purchases": [
           {"item": "sneakers", "price": 3000}
        ]
      }
      ]
      ```

  * It makes easier to add JSON data into reference columns by this feature.
  * Currently, this feature only support with JSON input.

* Added support for UNIX epoch time for ``time_classify_*`` functions.

* [query_parallel_or](/docs/reference/functions/query_parallel_or.html) Added a new function for processing queries in parallel.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for ignoring nonexistent sort keys.

  * Groonga had been outputted error when we specified nonexistent sort keys until now.
    However, Groonga ignore nonexistent sort keys since this release. (Groonga doesn't output error.)
  * This feature implements for consistency.
    Because we just ignore invalid values in ``output_columns`` and most of invalid values in ``sort_keys``.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for ignoring nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table``.

  * Groonga had been outputted error when we specified nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table`` until now.
    However, Groonga ignore nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table`` since this release. (Groonga doesn't output error.)
  * This feature implements for consistency.
    Because we just ignore invalid values in ``output_columns`` and most of invalid values in ``sort_keys``.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.8.

### Fixes

* [reference_acquire](/docs/reference/commands/reference_acquire.html) Fixed a bug that Groonga crash when a table's reference is acquired and a column is added to the table before auto release is happened.

  * Because the added column's reference isn't acquired but it's released on auto release.

* [Windows] Fixed a bug that one or more processes fail an output backtrace on SEGV when a new backtrace logging process starts when another backtrace logging process is running in another thread.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.
