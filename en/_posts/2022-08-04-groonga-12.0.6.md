### Improvements

* Added new Munin plugins for groonga-delta.

  We can monitoring the following items by plugins for groonga-delta.

    * Whether ``groonga-delta-import`` can import or not ``.grn`` file on local storage.
    * Whether ``groonga-delta-import`` can import or not difference data of MySQL.
    * Whether ``groonga-delta-apply`` can apply imported data or not.
    * The total size of applying data.

* [column_copy](/docs/reference/commands/column_copy.html) Added support for weight vector.

  We can copy the value of weight vector by ``column_copy`` as below.

  ```
  table_create Tags TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  table_create CopyFloat32Value TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create CopyFloat32Value source_tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT|WEIGHT_FLOAT32 Tags
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create CopyFloat32Value destination_tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT|WEIGHT_FLOAT32 Tags
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table CopyFloat32Value
  [
  {
    "_key": "Groonga is fast!!!",
    "source_tags": {
      "Groonga": 2.8,
      "full text search": 1.5
    }
  }
  ]
  [[0,0.0,0.0],1]
  column_copy CopyFloat32Value source_tags CopyFloat32Value destination_tags
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  select CopyFloat32Value
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          1
        ],
        [
          [
            "_id",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "_key",
            "ShortText"
          ],
          [
            "destination_tags",
            "Tags"
          ],
          [
            "source_tags",
            "Tags"
          ]
        ],
        [
          1,
          "Groonga is fast!!!",
          {
            "Groonga": 2.8,
            "full text search": 1.5
          },
          {
            "Groonga": 2.8,
            "full text search": 1.5
          }
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

* [Ubuntu](/docs/install/ubuntu.html) Dropped support for Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri).

  Because Ubuntu 21.10 reached EOL in July 2022.

* [Debian](/docs/install/debian.html) Dropped Debian 10 (buster) support.

  Because Debian 10 reaches EOL in August 2022.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that Groonga may crash when we execute drilldown in a parallel by ``n_workers`` option.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Fixed a bug that the syntax error occurred when we specify a very long expression in ``--filter``.

  Because the max stack size for the expression of ``--filter`` was 100 until now.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.

### Conclusion
