* [Tokenizers](/docs/reference/tokenizers.html) Added a new tokenizer `TokenPattern`.

* [Tokenizers](/docs/reference/tokenizers.html) Added a new tokenizer ``TokenTable``.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for similer search against index column.

### [Tokenizers](/docs/reference/tokenizers.html) Added a new tokenizer `TokenPattern`.

You can extract tokens by regular expression as below.
This tokenizer extracts only token that matches the regular expression.

You can also specify multiple patterns of regular expression.

```
tokenize 'TokenPattern("pattern", "\\\\$[0-9]", "pattern", "apples|oranges")' "I bought apples for $3 and oranges for $4."
[
  [
    0,
    1549612606.784344,
    0.0003230571746826172
  ],
  [
    {
      "value": "apples",
      "position": 0,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    },
    {
      "value": "$3",
      "position": 1,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    },
    {
      "value": "oranges",
      "position": 2,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    },
    {
      "value": "$4",
      "position": 3,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    }
  ]
]
```

### [Tokenizers](/docs/reference/tokenizers.html) Added a new tokenizer ``TokenTable``.

You can extract tokens by a key of existing a table as below.

```
table_create Keywords TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --normalizer NormalizerNFKC100
load --table Keywords
[
{"_key": "$4"},
{"_key": "apples"},
{"_key": "$3"}
]
tokenize 'TokenTable("table", "Keywords")' "I bought apples for $4 at $3."

    1549613095.146393,
    0.0003008842468261719
  ],
  [
    {
      "value": "apples",
      "position": 0,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    },
    {
      "value": "$4",
      "position": 1,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    },
    {
      "value": "$3",
      "position": 2,
      "force_prefix": false,
      "force_prefix_search": false
    }
  ]
]
```

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Supported similer search against index column.

If you have used multi column index, you can similar search against all source columns by this feature.

```
table_create Documents TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
column_create Documents content1 COLUMN_SCALAR Text
column_create Documents content2 COLUMN_SCALAR Text
table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY|KEY_NORMALIZE ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
column_create Terms document_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION Documents content1,content2

### [Normalizers](/docs/reference/normalizers.html) Added new option `remove_blank` for NormalizerNFKC100.

This option remove white spaces as below.

```
normalize 'NormalizerNFKC100("remove_blank", true)' "This is a pen."

  {
    "normalized": "thisisapen.",
    "types": [
    ],
    "checks": [
    ]
  }
]
```

### [groonga executable file](/docs/reference/executables/groonga.html) Improve display of thread id in log.

Because It was easy to confuse thread id and process id on Windows version, it made clear which is a thread id or a process id.

* (Before): `|2436|1032:`
  * `2436` is a process id. `1032` is a thread id.
* (After): `|2436|00001032:`
  * `2436` is a process id, `00001032` is a thread id.

### Conclusion

See [Release 9.0.0 2019-02-09](/docs/news.html#release-9-0-0) about detailed changes since 8.1.1
