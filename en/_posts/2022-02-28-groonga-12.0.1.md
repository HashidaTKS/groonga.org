### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [query_expand](/docs/reference/commands/query_expand.html) Added a support for synonym group.

  Until now, We had to each defined a keyword and synonyms of the keyword as below when we use the synonym search.

  ```
  table_create Thesaurus TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --normalizer NormalizerAuto
  # [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], true]
  column_create Thesaurus synonym COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
  # [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], true]
  load --table Thesaurus
  [
  {"_key": "mroonga", "synonym": ["mroonga", "tritonn", "groonga mysql"]},
  {"_key": "groonga", "synonym": ["groonga", "senna"]}
  ]
  ```

  In the above case, if we search ``mroonga``, Groonga search ``mroonga OR tritonn OR "groonga mysql"`` as we intended.
  However, if we search ``tritonn``, Groonga search only ``tritonn``.
  If we want to search ``tritonn OR mroonga OR "groonga mysql"`` even if we search ``tritonn``, we need had added a definition as below.

  ```
  load --table Thesaurus
  [
  {"_key": "tritonn", "synonym": ["tritonn", "mroonga", "groonga mysql"]},
  ]
  ```

  In many cases, if we expand ``mroonga`` to ``mroonga OR tritonn OR "groonga mysql"``, we feel we want to expand ``tritonn`` and ``"groonga mysql"`` to ``mroonga OR tritonn OR "groonga mysql"``.
  However, until now, we had needed additional definitions in such a case.
  Therefore, if target keywords for synonyms are many, we are troublesome to define synonyms.
  Because we need to define many similar definitions.

  In addition, when we remove synonyms, we are troublesome because we need to execute remove against many records.

  We can make a group by deciding on a representative synonym record since this release.
  For example, the all following keywords are the "mroonga" group.

  ```
  load --table Synonyms
  [
    {"_key": "mroonga": "representative": "mroonga"}
  ]

  load --table Synonyms
  [
    {"_key": "tritonn": "representative": "mroonga"},
    {"_key": "groonga mysql": "representative": "mroonga"}
  ]
  ```

  In this case, ``mroonga`` is expanded to ``mroonga OR tritonn OR "groonga mysql"``.
  In addition, ``tritonn`` and ``"groonga mysql"`` are also expanded to ``mroonga OR tritonn OR "groonga mysql"``.

  When we want to remove synonyms, we execute just remove against a target record.
  For example, if we want to remove ``"groonga mysql"`` from synonyms, we just remove ``{"_key": "groonga mysql": "representative": "mroonga"}``.

* [query_expand](/docs/reference/commands/query_expand.html) Added a support for text vector and index.

  We can use text vector in a synonym group as below.

  ```
  table_create SynonymGroups TABLE_NO_KEY
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create SynonymGroups synonyms COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  table_create Synonyms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Synonyms group COLUMN_INDEX SynonymGroups synonyms
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table SynonymGroups
  [
  ["synonyms"],
  [["rroonga", "Ruby groonga"]],
  [["groonga", "rroonga", "mroonga"]]
  ]
  [[0,0.0,0.0],2]
  query_expand Synonyms.group "rroonga"
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    "((rroonga) OR (Ruby groonga) OR (groonga) OR (rroonga) OR (mroonga))"
  ]
  ```

* Added support for disabling a backtrace by the environment variable.

  We can disable output a backtrace by using ``GRN_BACK_TRACE_ENABLE``.
  If we set ``GRN_BACK_TRACE_ENABLE=no``, Groonga doesn't output a backtrace.

  Groonga output backtrace to a stack area. Therefore, Groonga may crash because Groonga uses up stack area depending on the OS.
  In such cases, we can avoid crashes by using ``GRN_BACK_TRACE_ENABLE=no``.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved performance for ``--slices``.

* [Windows] Added support for Visual Studio 2022.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for specifing max intervals for each elements in near search.

  For example, we can specify max intervals for each phrase in a near phrase search.
  We make documentation for this feature in the future. Therefore, we will make more details later.   

* [groonga-server-http](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-server-http.html) We could use ``groonga-server-http`` even if Groonga of RPM packages.

### Fixes

* [Windows] Fixed a crash bug when Groonga output backtrace.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.
