[Groonga 9.0.1](/docs/news.html#release-9-0-1) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added new argument `--load_table`, `--load_columns` and `--load_values`.

* Added ``index_column_diff`` command to check broken index column. (This feature is during verification.)

* Fixed a bug that deleted records may be matched because of updating indexes incorrectly.

  * It may occure when large number of records is added or deleted.

* Fixed a memory leak when ``logical_range_filter`` returns no records.

* Fixed a bug that query will not match because of loading data is not normalized correctly.
  
  * This bug occurs when load data contains whitespace after KATAKANA and ``unify_kana`` option is used for tokenizer.

* Fixed a bug that an indexes is broken during updating indexes.

  * It may occurs when repeating to add large number of records or delete them for a long term.

* Fixed a crash bug that allocated working area is not enough size when updating indexes.

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added new argument `--load_table`, `--load_columns` and `--load_values`.

We can store a result of `select` in a table that specifying `--load_table`.

`--load_values` option specifies columns of result of `select`.

`--load_columns` options specifies columns of table that specifying `--load_table`.

In this way, we can store values of columns that specifying with `--load_values` into columns that specifying with `--load_columns`.

For example, we can store `_id` and `timestamp` that a result of `select` in a Logs table specified by `--load_table` as below.

```
table_create Logs_20150203 TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
column_create Logs_20150203 timestamp COLUMN_SCALAR Time

table_create Logs TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
column_create Logs original_id COLUMN_SCALAR UInt32
column_create Logs timestamp_text COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

load --table Logs_20150203
[
{
  "_key": "2015-02-03:1",
  "timestamp": "2015-02-03 10:49:00"
},
{
  "_key": "2015-02-03:2",
  "timestamp": "2015-02-03 12:49:00"
}
]

### Added ``index_column_diff`` command to check broken index column. (This feature is during the verification.)

We can check the broken index by this command. However, this feature has been during the verification yet.

This command compares values of an index column to tokenized an index source values and display diff of them.

We can use this command as below. 

  * We specify the name of an index table name includes an index column of a target in the first argument.
  * We specify the index name of the target in the second argument.

```
index_column_diff index_table_name index_column_name
```

result of this command have three items as below

* ``token`` : This item shows broken token.
* ``remains`` : This item shows it has remained posting-list in index unintentionally.
* ``missings`` : This item shows it has been deleted posting-list in index unintentionally.

If indexes are normal, this command returns empty value as below.

```
index_column_diff --table Term --name data_index
[[0,1553654816.796513,0.001804113388061523],[]]
```
