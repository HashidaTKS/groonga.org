### Added support for array literal with multiple elements.

We can use array literal with multiple elements into ``filter`` condition as below.

```
table_create Values TABLE_NO_KEY

column_create Values numbers COLUMN_VECTOR Int32

load --table Values
[
{"numbers": [2, 1, 3]},
{"numbers": [2, 3, 4]},
{"numbers": [8, 9, -1]}
]

select Values  \
  --filter 'numbers == [2, 3, 4]'  \
  --output_columns 'numbers'
[[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["numbers","Int32"]],[[2,3,4]]]]]
```

### Added support equivalence operation of a vector.

We can use equivalencs operation for a vector as below.

```
table_create Values TABLE_NO_KEY

column_create Values numbers COLUMN_VECTOR Int32

load --table Values
[
{"numbers": [2, 1, 3]},
{"numbers": [2, 3, 4]},
{"numbers": [8, 9, -1]}
]

select Values  \
  --filter 'numbers == [2, 3, 4]'  \
  --output_columns 'numbers'
[[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["numbers","Int32"]],[[2,3,4]]]]]
```

### [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html) Increase outputting logs into query log.

``logical_range_filter`` command comes to output a log for below timing.

* After filtering by ``logical_range_filter``.
* After sorting by ``logical_range_filter``.
* After applying dynamic column.
* After output results.

We can see how much has been finished this command by this feature.

### [grndb](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) Added support new option ``--since``

We can specify a scope of an inspection.

We can specify the modified time as ISO 8601 format or -NUNIT format such as -3days or -2.5weeks format.

Here is an example that specifies --since option in ISO 8601 format:

```
% grmdb check --since=2019-06-24T18:16:22 /var/lib/groonga/db/db
```

In above example, the objects which are modified after 2019-06-24T18:16:22 are checked.

Here is an example that specifies --since option in -NUNIT format:

```
% grmdb check --since=-7d /var/lib/groonga/db/db
```

In above example, the objects which are modified in recent 7 days are checked.

Please also refer to [grndb#since](/docs/reference/executables/grndb#since).

### [query](/docs/reference/functions/query.html) Added ``default_operator``.

We can customize operator when "keyword1 keyword2".
"keyword1 Keyword2" is AND operation in default.

We can change "keyword1 keyword2"'s operator except AND as below.

```
table_create Products TABLE_NO_KEY

column_create Products name COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

load --table Products
[
["name"],
["Groonga"],
["Mroonga"],
["Rroonga"],
["PGroonga"],
["Ruby"],
["PostgreSQL"]
]

select \
  --table Products \
  --filter 'query("name", "Groonga Mroonga", {"default_operator": "OR"})'
[
  [
    0,
    0.0,
    0.0
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        3
      ],
      [
        [
          "_id",
          "UInt32"
        ],
        [
          "name",
          "ShortText"
        ]
      ],
      [
        1,
        "Groonga"
      ],
      [
        4,
        "PGroonga"
      ],
      [
        2,
        "Mroonga"
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
```
