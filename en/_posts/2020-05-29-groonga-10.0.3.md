## Groonga 10.0.3 has been released

[Groonga 10.0.3](/docs/news.html#release-10-0-3) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * We came to be able to construct an inverted index from data that are tokenized in advance.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) We came to be able to specify a ``vector`` for the argument of a function.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added a new stage ``result_set`` for dynamic columns.

    * This stage generates a column into a result set table. Therefore, it is not generated if ``query`` or ``filter`` doesn't exist

      * Because if ``query`` or ``filter`` doesn't exist, Groonga doesn't make a result set table.

    * We can't use ``_value`` for the stage. The ``result_set`` stage is for storing value by ``score_column``.

  * [vector_slice] Added support for weight vector that has weight of ``Float32`` type.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for ``filtered`` stage and ``output`` stage of dynamic columns on drilldowns.

    * We can use ``filtered`` and ``output`` stage of dynamic columns on drilldowns as with ``drilldowns[Label].stage filtered`` and ``drilldowns[Label].stage output``.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for ``Float`` type value in aggregating on drilldown.

    * We can aggregate max value, min value, and sum value for ``Float`` type value using ``MAX``, ``MIN``, and ``SUM``.

  * [query](/docs/reference/functions/query.html), [geo_in_rectangle](/docs/reference/functions/geo_in_rectangle.html), [geo_in_circle](/docs/reference/functions/geo_in_circle.html) Added a new option ``score_column`` for ``query()``, ``geo_in_rectangle()``, and ``geo_in_circle()``.

  * [Windows] Groonga came to be able to output backtrace when it occurs error even if it doesn't crash.

  * [Windows] Dropped support for old Windows.

    * Groonga for Windows come to require Windows 8 (Windows Server 2012) or later from 10.0.3.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved sort performance when sort keys were mixed referable sort keys and the other sort keys.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved sort performance when sort keys are all referable keys case.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improve scorer performance as a ``_socre = column1*X + column2*Y + ...`` case.

    * This optimization effective when there are many ``+`` or ``*`` in ``_score``.
    * At the moment, it has only effective against ``+`` and ``*``.

  * [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for phrase near search.

  * [vector](/docs/reference/columns/vector.html) Added support for ``float32`` weight vector.

  * Fixed a crash bug if the modules (tokenizers, normalizers, and token filters) are used at the same time from multiple threads.

  * Fixed precision of ``Float32`` value when it outputted.

    * The precision of it changes to  8-digit to 7-digit from 10.0.3.

  * Fixed a bug that Groonga used the wrong cache when the query that just the parameters of dynamic column different was executed.

### We came to be able to construct an inverted index from data that are tokenized in advance.

* The construct of an index is speeded up from this.

* We need to prepare token column to use this improvement.

* token column is an auto generated value column like an index column.

* token column value is generated from source column value by tokenizing the source column value.

* We can create a token column by setting the source column as below.

  ```
  table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
    --normalizer NormalizerNFKC121 \
    --default_tokenizer TokenNgram

  table_create Notes TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Notes title COLUMN_SCALAR Text

  # The last "title" is the source column.
  column_create Notes title_terms COLUMN_VECTOR Terms title
  ```

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) We came to be able to specify a ``vector`` for the argument of a function.

* For example, ``flags`` options of ``query`` can describe by a ``vector`` as below.

  ```
  select \
    --table Memos \
    --filter 'query("content", "-content:@mroonga", \
                    { \
                      "expander": "QueryExpanderTSV", \
                      "flags": ["ALLOW_LEADING_NOT", "ALLOW_COLUMN"] \
                    })'
  ```

### [query](/docs/reference/functions/query.html), [geo_in_rectangle](/docs/reference/functions/geo_in_rectangle.html), [geo_in_circle](/docs/reference/functions/geo_in_circle.html) Added a new option ``score_column`` for ``query()``, ``geo_in_rectangle()``, and ``geo_in_circle()``.

* We can store a score value by condition using ``score_column``.

* Normally, Groonga calculate a score by adding scores of all conditions. However, we sometimes want to get a score value by condition.

* For example, if we want to only use how near central coordinate as score as below, we use ``score_column``.

  ]
  ```

* The sort by ``_score`` is meaningless in the above example. Because the value of ``_score`` is all ``1`` by ``category == "Tower"``.
  However, we can sort distance from central coordinate using ``score_column``.

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved sort performance when sort keys were mixed referable sort keys and the other sort keys.

* We improved sort performance if mixed referable sort keys and the other and there are referable keys two or more.

  * Referable sort keys are sort keys that except below them.

    * Compressed columns
    * ``_value`` against the result of drilldown that is specified multiple values to the key of drilldown.
    * ``_key`` against patricia trie table that has not the key of ``ShortText`` type.
    * ``_score``

* The more sort keys that except string, a decrease in the usage of memory for sort.

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for phrase near search.

* We can search phrase by phrase by a near search.

  * Query syntax for near phrase search is ``*NP"Phrase1 phrase2 ..."``.
  * Script syntax for near phrase search is ``column *NP "phrase1 phrase2 ..."``.

  * If the search target phrase includes space, we can search for it by surrounding it with ``"`` as below.

    ```

      --normalizer NormalizerNFKC121
    column_create Terms entries_content COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries content

    [
    {"content": "I started to use Groonga. It's very fast!"},

    ]

    select Entries --filter 'content *NP "\\"I started\\" \\"use Groonga\\""' --output_columns 'content'
    [

        1590469700.715882,

          ],
          [
            [
              "content",
              "Text"
            ]
          ],
          [
            "I started to use Groonga. It's very fast!"
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
    ```

### [vector](/docs/reference/columns/vector.html) Added support for ``float32`` weight vector.

* We can store weight as ``float32`` instead of ``uint32``.
* We need to add ``WEIGHT_FLOAT32`` flag when execute ``column_create`` to use this feature.

  ```
  column_create Records tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT|WEIGHT_FLOAT32 Tags
  ```

* However, ``WEIGHT_FLOAT32`` flag isn't available with ``COLUMN_INDEX`` flag for now.

### Conclusion

Let's search by Groonga!
