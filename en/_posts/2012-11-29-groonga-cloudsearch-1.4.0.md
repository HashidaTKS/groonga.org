h2. Groonga CloudSearch 1.4.0 has been released

We have released [Groonga CloudSearch](http://gcs.groonga.org/) 1.4.0.

Groonga CloudSearch is a full text search system based on groonga.
It provides [Amazon CloudSearch](http://aws.amazon.com/en/cloudsearch/)
compatible API. It is useful if you are planning to build new Web apps
with the Amazon CloudSearch.

This release includes improvements about API compatibility to the
Amazon
CloudSearch and configurations of the daemon.
We also have shipped Groonga CloudSearch Console 1.1.0. This provides
an administration web console for Groonga CloudSearch. You can manage
your Groonga CloudSearch Server with web UI.

See the [blog
post](http://gcs.groonga.org/blog/2012/11/29/1.4.0-release/)
