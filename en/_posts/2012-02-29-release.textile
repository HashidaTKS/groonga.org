"Groonga 2.0.0":/docs/news.html#release-2-0-0 has been released!

How to install: "Install":/docs/install.html

h3. Offline index construction is supported

Until now, groonga only supports online index construction because groonga values freshness. But groonga 2.0.0 supports offline index construction for a search system that updates documents by batch.

Index construction throughput by offline index construction is 3 times - 10 times faster rather than one by online index construction.

If your search system updates documents by batch, please use offline index construction.
