## Groonga 12.0.0 has been released

[Groonga 12.0.0](/docs/news.html#release-12-0-0) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [sub_filter](/docs/reference/functions/sub_filter.html) Added a new option ``pre_filter_threshold``.

  We can change the value of ``GRN_SUB_FILTER_PRE_FILTER_THRESHOLD`` by this option.
  If the number of records is less than ``GRN_SUB_FILTER_PRE_FILTER_THRESHOLD`` when Groonga executes ``sub_filter``, Groonga execute ``sub_filter`` against records that have been already narrowed down.  

  We can use ``-1`` to always use this optimization.

* [index_column_have_source_record] Added a new function ``index_column_have_source_record()``.

  We can confirm whether a token that is existing in the index is included in any of the records that are registered in Groonga or not.

  Groonga does not remove a token even if the token become never used from records in Groonga by updating records.
  Therefore, for example, when we use the feature of autocomplete, Groonga may return a token that is not included in any of the records as candidates for search words.
  However, we can become that we don't return the needless token by using this function.

  Because this function can detect a token that is not included in any of the records.

* [NormalizerNFKC130](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_nfkc130.html) Added a new option ``strip``

  This option removes spaces from the start and the end as below.

  ```
   normalize \
   'NormalizerNFKC121("strip", true, \
                      "report_source_offset", true)' \
   "  hello world\t! \t " \

          12,
          14
        ]
      }
    ]
  ```

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added new arguments ``drilldown_max_n_target_records`` and ``drilldown[${LABEL}].max_n_target_records``.

  We can specify the max number of records of the drilldown target table (filtered result) to use drilldown.
  If the number of filtered result is larger than the specified value, some records in filtered result aren't used for drilldown.
  The default value of this arguments are ``-1``.
  If these arguments are set ``-1``, Groonga uses all records for drilldown.

  This argument is useful when filtered result may be very large.
  Because a drilldown against large filtered result may be slow.
  We can limit the max number of records to be used for drilldown by this feature.

  Here is an example to limit the max number of records to be used for drilldown.
  The last 2 records, ``{\"_id\": 4, \"tag\": \"Senna\"}`` and ``{\"_id\": 5, \"tag\": \"Senna\"}``, aren't used.

  ```

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.21.6.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.
