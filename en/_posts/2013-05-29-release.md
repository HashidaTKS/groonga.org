Groonga 3.0.4 has been released
-------------------------------

[Groonga 3.0.4](/docs/news.html#release-3-0-4) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

There are three topics for this release.

-   Supported multiple index section in match_columns
-   Supported tokenize command experimentally
-   Supported Debian 8.0 (jessie)

### Supported multiple index section in match_columns

In this release, we began to support multiple index section in
match_columns.

Here is the sample schema:

    table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
    column_create Memos title COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
    column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

    table_create Lexicon TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
    column_create Lexicon title_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION Memos title
    column_create Lexicon content_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION Memos content

In the previous release, you need to execute following query if you want
to use column index of title with weight.

    select Memos 
      --match_columns "Lexicon.title_index * 10 || Lexicon.content_index" 
      --query rroonga --output_columns "title, content, _score"

In this release, you can use almost same thing for multiple column
index. To use this feature, you need change schema a bit.

    table_create Lexicon TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
    column_create Lexicon memo_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION Memos title,content

Then specify memo_index.(COLUMN_NAME) in the query. Here is the
revised query using multiple column index:

    select Memos 
      --match_columns "Lexicon.memo_index.title * 10 || Lexicon.memo_index.content" 
      --query rroonga 
      --output_columns "title, content, _score"

There are many case which you want to apply multiple tokenizer or
normalizer for each column.

If you specify just column name, there is a case that multiple index is
used and unwanted search results returns.

In this release, you can specify specific column which is a member of
multiple column index.

### Supported tokenize command experimentally

In this release, we began to support tokenize command experimentally.

There is a normalize command to confirm behaviour of normalizer, on the
other hand, there is no way to confirm behaviour of tokenizer.

In this release, you can confirm both of normalizer and tokenizer
behaviour now.

Here is the syntax of tokenize command:

    tokenize tokenizer string [normalizer] [flag]

Here is a sample of tokenize command:

    > tokenize TokenBigram "groonga3.0.4"
    [
      [0,1369290009.77065,0.000670194625854492],
      [
        {"value":"gr","position":0},
        {"value":"ro","position":1},
        {"value":"oo","position":2},
        {"value":"on","position":3},
        {"value":"ng","position":4},
        {"value":"ga","position":5},
        {"value":"a3","position":6},
        {"value":"3.","position":7},
        {"value":".0","position":8},
        {"value":"0.","position":9},
        {"value":".4","position":10},
        {"value":"4","position":11}
      ]
    ]

[documentation](http://groonga.org/docs/reference/commands/tokenize.html)
about details.

### Supported Debian 8.0 (jessie)

In this release, we began to support Debian 8.0 (jessie).
