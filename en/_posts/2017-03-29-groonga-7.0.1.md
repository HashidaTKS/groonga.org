## Groonga 7.0.1 has been released

[Groonga 7.0.1](/docs/news.html#release-7-0-1) has been released! 

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * Dropped CentOS 5 support
  * Fixed a problem about dynamically updated index size
  * [experimental] Supported ``GRN_ORDER_BY_ESTIMATED_SIZE_ENABLE``

#### Dropped CentOS 5 support

CentOS 5 will reach EOL at March 31, 2017. So, Groonga packages on CentOS 5 won't be shipped anymore.

We recommends to migrate CentOS 5 environment to CentOS 6 or later.

#### Fixed a problem about dynamically updated index size

Since Groonga 6.1.4 release, there is a problem about dynamically updated index size was increased.

Here is the example how Groonga database size is increased:

This problem was fixed in this release!

#### [experimental] Supported ``GRN_ORDER_BY_ESTIMATED_SIZE_ENABLE``

In this release, ``GRN_ORDER_BY_ESTIMATED_SIZE_ENABLE`` environment variable was supported.

This variable controls whether query optimization which is based on estimated size is applied or not. This feature is disabled by default. 

Set ``GRN_ORDER_BY_ESTIMATED_SIZE_ENABLE=yes`` if you want to try it.
