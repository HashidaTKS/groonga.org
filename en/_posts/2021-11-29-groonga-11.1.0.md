## Groonga 11.1.0 has been released

[Groonga 11.1.0](/docs/news.html#release-11-1-0) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for ISO 8601 time format.

  ``load`` support the following format by this modification.

    * YYYY-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sZ
    * YYYY-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.s+10:00
    * YYYY-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.s-10:00

  We can also use ``t`` and ``z`` characters instead of ``T`` and ``Z`` in this syntax.
  We can also use ``/`` character instead of ``-`` in this syntax. However, note that this is not an ISO 8601 format.
  This format is present for compatibility.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added a new ``query_flags`` ``DISABLE_PREFIX_SEARCH``.

  We can use the prefix search operators ``^`` and ``*`` as search keywords
  by ``DISABLE_PREFIX_SEARCH`` as below.

  This feature is useful if we want to search documents including ``^`` and ``*``.

    ```
    table_create Users TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

    load --table Users
    [
    {"_key": "alice"},
    {"_key": "alan"},
    {"_key": "ba*"}
    ]

    select Users \
      --match_columns "_key" \
      --query "a*" \
      --query_flags "DISABLE_PREFIX_SEARCH"
    [[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["_id","UInt32"],["_key","ShortText"]],[3,"ba*"]]]]
    ```

    ```
    table_create Users TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

    load --table Users
    [
    {"_key": "alice"},
    {"_key": "alan"},
    {"_key": "^a"}
    ]

    select Users \
      --query "_key:^a" \
      --query_flags "ALLOW_COLUMN|DISABLE_PREFIX_SEARCH"
    [[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["_id","UInt32"],["_key","ShortText"]],[3,"^a"]]]]
    ```

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added a new ``query_flags`` ``DISABLE_AND_NOT``.

  We can use ``AND NOT`` operators ``-`` as search keywords
  by ``DISABLE_AND_NOT`` as below.

  This feature is useful if we want to search documents including ``-``.

    ```
    table_create Users TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

    load --table Users
    [
    {"_key": "alice"},
    {"_key": "bob"},
    {"_key": "cab-"}
    ]

    select Users   --match_columns "_key"   --query "b - a"   --query_flags "DISABLE_AND_NOT"
    [[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["_id","UInt32"],["_key","ShortText"]],[3,"cab-"]]]]
    ```

### Fixes

* [The browser based administration tool] Fixed a bug that a search query
  that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to
  the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.
