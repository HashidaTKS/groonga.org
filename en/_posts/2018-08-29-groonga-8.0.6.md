## Groonga 8.0.6 has been released

[Groonga 8.0.6](/docs/news.html#release-8-0-6) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* Optimizer is a built-in feature now.
* Enable sequential search for enough filtered case by default.
* `load` command now supports the `lock_table` option.

#### Optimizer is a built-in feature now

The optimizer plugin has became a built-in feature.
It is disabled by default, and you need to set `GRN_EXPR_OPTIMIZE=yes` (or use the `expression_rewriters` plugin as before) for activation.

#### Enable sequential search for enough filtered case by default

Groonga now finds results by sequential search, from enough narrowed results.
It may be faster than regular index search for very narrowed results, like less than 1000 records which is 1% of all results.

You can disable this feature by setting an environment variable: `GRN_TABLE_SELECT_ENOUGH_FILTERED_RATIO=0.0`

#### `load` command now supports the `lock_table` option

Now `load --lock_table yes` command line loads data with locking of the target table, while updating columns and applying `--each`.
It avoids conflict of `load` and `delete`, but it will reduce the performance of loading.

### Conclusion

See [Release 8.0.6 2018-08-29](/docs/news.html#release-8-0-6) about detailed changes since 8.0.5
