## Groonga 9.1.1 has been released

[Groonga 9.1.1](/docs/news.html#release-9-1-1) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for Apache Arrow format data.

  * If we use Apache Arrow format data, we may reduce parse cost. Therefore, data might be loading faster than other formats.
  * Groonga can also directly input data for Apache Arrow format from other data analysis systems by this improvement.
  * However, Apache Arrow format can use in the HTTP interface only. We can't use it in the command line interface.

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Improve error message.

  * Response of `load` command includes error message also.
  * If we faile data load, Groonga output error detail of ``load`` command as below by this Improvement.

  ```
  table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR Text
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table Memos
  [
  {"content": "Groonga is fast"}
  ]
  [[0,0.0,0.0],1]
  load --table Memos
  [
  {"_id": "invalid", "content": "Mroonga is fast"}
  ]
  [[[-22,0.0,0.0],"<_id>: failed to cast to <UInt32>: <\"invalid\">"],0]
  ```

  * If we want to output multiple error messages, we use `output_errors` option of `command_version 3` as below.

  ```
  table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR Text
  [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table Memos --command_version 3 --output_errors yes
  [
  {"_id": "invalid", "content": "Groonga is fast"},
  {"_id": "invalid", "content": "Mroonga is fast"}
  ]
  {
    "header":{
      "return_code":-22,
      "start_time":1576717803.408522,
      "elapsed_time":0.8798723220825195,
      "error":{
        "message":"<_id>: failed to cast to <UInt32>: <\"invalid\">",
        "function":"parse_id_value",
        "file":"load.c","line":394
      }
    },
    "body":{
      "n_loaded_records":0,
      "errors":[
        {
          "return_code":-22,
          "message":"<_id>: failed to cast to <UInt32>: <\"invalid\">"
        },
        {
          "return_code":-22,
          "message":"<_id>: failed to cast to <UInt32>: <\"invalid\">"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.17.7.

* [Groonga HTTP server](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-server-http.html) Added support for sending command parameters by body of HTTP request.

  * We must set ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` to ``Content-Type`` for this case.
  * If we use the HTTP POST request, we can specify multiple parameters as below by the HTTP request body.

  ```
  POST /d/status HTTP/1.1
  Host: 127.0.0.1:10041
  Content-Length: 35
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  command_version=3&output_pretty=yes
  ```
