### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [[column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create)] Added more validations for `column_create`
* [[vector_find](/docs/reference/functions/vector_find)] Added a new function `vector_find()`

#### Added more validations for `column_create`

* 1: Full text search index for vector column must have WITH_SECTION flag.
  * Accept TokenDelmit with `WITH_POSITION`. It's useful pattern for tag search.

#### Added a new function `vector_find()`

### Future of Debian jessie support plan

As you know, last Debian jessie point release had been released.

* [Updated Debian 8: 8.11 released](https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180623)

So, we will plan to stop providing newer Groonga packages for Debian jessie from next month.
We recommend to upgrade to Debian stretch.
