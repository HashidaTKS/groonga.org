## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 1.1.9 has been released

[PGroonga](httsp://pgroonga.github.io/) (píːzí:lúnɡά) (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 1.1.9 has been released!

See [PGroonga 1.0.0 release announce]({% post_url 2015-10-29-pgroonga-1.0.0 %}) about PGroonga.

## Benchmark

We have published benchmark result with Wikipedia data to the official site.

Here are compared modules:

  * textsearch in PostgreSQL
  * pg\_trgm in contrib
  * pg\_bigm - third party module

English Wikipedia data are used for textsearch and pg\_trgm because they don't support Asian languages such as Japanese.

Japanese Wikipedia data are used for pg\_bigm because it supports Asian languages such as Japanese.

### PGroonga, textsearch and pg\_trgm

This section describes about benchmark result summary with PGroonga, textsearch and pg\_trgm. See [PGroonga versus textsearch and pg\_trgm](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-textsearch-and-pg-trgm.html) for details.

Here is search time benchmark result.

pg\_trgm is very slower than PGroonga and textsearch as the following. (Bar length means elapsed time in ms. It means that shorter bar means more faster.)

Here is the graph without pg\_trgm. PGroonga and textsearch have similar performance. "Groonga" is a case that search by Groonga directly by [`pgroonga.command` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-command.html). Groonga is the full text search engine used by PGroonga. Groonga is 10x faster than PGroonga and textsearch.

Here is index creation time benchmark.

PGroonga is the most fastest module as the following. PGroonga is about 2x faster than textsearch and about 30% faster than pg\_trgm.

### PGroonga and pg\_bigm

This section describes about benchmark result summary with PGroonga and pg\_bigm. See [PGroonga versus pg\_bigm](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-pg-bigm.html) for details.

Here is search time benchmark result.

pg\_bigm is very slower than PGroonga when query contains 3 or more characters. (Bar length means elapsed time in ms. It means that shorter bar means more faster.)

![Search time by PGroonga and pg\_bigm](/images/blog/en/2016-11-30-pgroonga-1.1.9/ja-search-without-groonga.svg)

Here is index creation time benchmark.

PGroonga is about 75% faster than pg\_bigm as the following.

## Changes

Here are changes since [1.1.1](/en/blog/2016/8/31/pgroonga-1.1.1.html). We recommend you to upgrade to 1.1.9 because some search related problems are fixed and new features such as replication support and Zstandard support are implemented. See links in the list for details.

  * [Experimental] Supported WAL. PGroonga isn't crash safe but supports [replication](https://pgroonga.github.io/en/reference/replication.html). PostgreSQL 9.6 or later and MessagePack are needed.
  * [[Windows](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/windows.html)] Fixed a bug that `SELECT` may be crashed.
  * Supported `Windows-1252` encoding.
  * [[Windows](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/windows.html)] Fixed a bug that `CREATE EXTENSION pgroonga` is failed.
  * [[Windows](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/windows.html)] Upgraded bundled Groonga to 6.1.1.
  * [[Windows](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/windows.html)] Supported packages for both PostgreSQL 9.5.5 and 9.6.1.
  * Supported `integer` in `IN`.
  * Fixed a bug that some records may be found after `UPDATE` or `DELETE`. (Reported by yongxianggao-chanjet)
  * Fixed a memory leak of [`pgroonga.score` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-score.html) (Reported by Takahashi)
  * Fixed a bug that PGroonga indexes created in non default tablespace are removed on `VACUUM`. (Reported by yongxianggao-chanjet)
  * Supported tablespace.
  * Disabled index only scan when there are one or more large record.
  * [[Ubuntu](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/ubuntu.html)] Dropped Wily Werewolf (15.10) support.
  * [[Ubuntu](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/ubuntu.html)] Supported Yakkety Yak (16.10).
  * Supported text data compression by Zstandard.
  * Supported text data compression by zlib.
  * Supported PGroonga version logging on startup.
  * Added [`pgroonga_tuple_is_alive` Groonga function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/groonga-functions/pgroonga-tuple-is-alive.html). You can remove dead tuples in PostgreSQL by this Groonga function. You can use this Groonga function with [`groonga.command` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-command.html).
  * Reduced memory usage on `CREATE INDEX`.
  * Supported backtrace logging on crash. (It doesn't work on Windows.)
  * Supported logging with PID.
  * Supported optimization when the following functions are called with constant arguments:
    * [`pgroonga.table_name` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-table-name.html)
    * [`pgroonga.snippet_html` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-snippet-html.html)
    * [`pgroonga.highlight_html` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-highlight-html.html)
    * [`pgroonga.match_positions_byte` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-match-positions-byte.html)
    * [`pgroonga.match_positions_character` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-match-positions-character.html)
    * [`pgroonga.query_extract_keywords` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-query-extract-keywords.html)
  * Added [`pgroonga.escape` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-escape.html). It escapes script syntax value.
  * Added [`pgroonga.query_escape` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-query-escape.html). It escapes query syntax value.
  * Added [`pgroonga.command_escape_escape` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-query-escape.html). It escaped Groonga command argument value.
  * Changed the return type of [`pgroonga.table_name` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-table-name.html) to `text` from `cstring`.
  * Added a new call style to [`pgroonga.command` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-command.html). You can pass Groonga command arguments as an array. If you specify arguments an array, arguments are escaped automatically. It prevents Groonga command injection security risk.
  * Supported query log. Use [`pgroonga.query_log_path` parameter](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/parameters/query-log-path.html) to control query log location and enabling/disabling query log.

## How to upgrade

This version is compatible with 1.1.1 or later. Upgrade by steps in ["Compatible case" in Upgrade document](https://pgroonga.github.io/upgrade/#compatible-case).

## Announce

There is [PGroonga session](http://www.pgconf.asia/EN/day-2/#A4) in PGConf.ASIA 2016 DAY 2. In this session, not only difference between PGroonga and other modules but also how to implement replication by generic WAL API added since PostgreSQL 9.6 are described. The slide for the session has been published:

  * [PGroonga - Make PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all languages!](https://slide.rabbit-shocker.org/authors/kou/pgconf-asia-2016/)

If you're interested in PGroonga, please go to the session.

## Conclusion

New PGroonga version has been released.

Try PGroonga when you want to perform fast full text search against all languages on PostgreSQL!
