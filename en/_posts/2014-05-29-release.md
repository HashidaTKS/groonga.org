# Groonga 4.0.2 has been released

[Groonga 4.0.2](/docs/news.html#release-4-0-2) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

## Changes

Here are new features in the release:

  * Supported daylight saving time.
  * Added [tokenizer_list](/docs/reference/commands/tokenizer_list.html). (experimental)
  * Added [normalizer_list](/docs/reference/commands/tokenizer_list.html). (experimental)

`tokenizer_list` and `normalizer_list` are for improving admin page. They are implemented by [@naoa_y](https://twitter.com/naoa_y). Thanks!

HTTP response is changed on error. In earlier releases, `500` (Internal Server Error) is returned for syntax error in `query` option value of [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) command. Since this release, `400` (Bad Request) is returned for the case. Because syntax error is not a server problem. It is a client problem. If your application depends on `500`, please fix your application.

Munin plugins support [groonga-httpd](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.html). You can use them without additional configuration. If they don't work well, please report it at [groonga-talk](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/groonga-talk).

This release also includes a fix of a crash bug. If you are using multi column index and has 1 million over records in Groonga or Groonga based software such as Mroonga, you may face the crash bug. If you match the condition, it is recommend that you upgrade Groonga.

## Groonga on Heroku

There is a [Groonga buildpack](https://github.com/groonga/heroku-buildpack-groonga). You can use the latest Groonga with the buildpack.

You can use Groonga in your Heroku application with the buildpack. Try the following command:

    % heroku create --buildpack https://codon-buildpacks.s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks/groonga/groonga.tgz

Your Heroku application runs  [groonga-httpd](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.html) by default.

Your Heroku application must has `groonga/` directory. You put `*.grn` files into the directory. The buildpack loads the `*.grn` files on `git push heroku master` into your Groonga database.

You can also use [Rroonga](http://ranguba.org/#about-rroonga) on Heroku with a [Rroonga buildpack](https://github.com/groonga/heroku-buildpack-rroonga). See the link for details.

## Easy to deploy
