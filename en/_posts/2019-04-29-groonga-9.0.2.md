## Groonga 9.0.2 has been released

[Groonga 9.0.2](/docs/news.html#release-9-0-2) has been released!

We provide a package for Windows made from VC++ from this release.

We also provide a package for Windows made form MinGW as in the past.

However, we will provide it made from VC++ instead of making from MinGW sooner or later.

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html) Added a new flag `INDEX_LARGE` for index column.

* [object_inspect](/docs/reference/commands/object_inspect.html) Added a new statistics `next_physical_segment_id` and `max_n_physical_segments` for physical segment information.

* [logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html) Added support for window function over shard.

* [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html) Added support for window function over shard.

* [logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html) Added support for window function over shard.

* [io_flush](/docs/reference/commands/io_flush) Added a new option `--recursive dependent`

* Fixed "unknown type name 'bool'" compilation error in some environments.

* Fixed a bug that incorrect output number over Int32.

### [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html) Added a new flag `INDEX_LARGE` for index column.

We can make an index column has space that two times of default by this flag.
However, note that it also uses two times of memory usage.

This flag useful when index target data are large.
Large data must have many records (normally at least 10 millions records) and at least one of the following features.

  * Index targets are multiple columns
  * Index table has tokenizer

Here is an example to create a large index column:

```
  column_create \
  --table Terms \
  --name people_roles_large_index \
  --flags COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION|INDEX_LARGE \
  --type People \
  --source roles
  [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], true]
```

### [object_inspect](/docs/reference/commands/object_inspect.html) Added a new statistics `next_physical_segment_id` and `max_n_physical_segments` for physical segment information.

`next_physical_segment_id` is the ID of the segment to the inspected index column use next.
That is this number shows currently the usage of the segment.

`max_n_physical_segments` is the max number of segments.

The max number of these statistics depend on index size:

  |Index column size|The max number of segments|
  |:---------------:|:------------------------:|
  |`INDEX_SMALL`|`2**9` (512)|
  |`INDEX_MEDIUM`|`2**16` (65536)|
  |`INDEX_LARGE`|`2**17 * 2` (262144)|
  |Default|`2**17` (131072)|

### [logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html) Added support for window function over shard.

We can apply the window function to over multiple tables.
However, we need to align the same order for shard key and leading group key or sort key.

For example, we can apply the window function to over multiple tables as below case.
Because the below example aligns the same order for shard key and leading group key.

The leading group key is price and shard key is timestamp in the below example:

```

### [io_flush](/docs/reference/commands/io_flush) Added a new option `--recursive dependent`

We can flush not only target object and child objects, but also related objects by this option.

The related objects are:

  * A referenced table
  * A related index column (There is source column in target TABLE_NAME)
  * A table of related index column (There is source column in target TABLE_NAME)

Here is an example to use this option:

```
  io_flush --recursive "dependent" --target_name "Users"
```
