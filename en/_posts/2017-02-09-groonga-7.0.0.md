### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * [`lock_clear`](/docs/reference/commands/lock_clear) Changed to clear metadata lock by lock_clear against DB.

  * Supported `groonga-token-filter-stem` package which provides stemming feature by `TokenFilterStem` token filter on CentOS 7.
  * [`load`](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Supported `--output_errors` yes option. If you specify "yes", you can get errors for each load failed record.
