How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for near phrase product search.

  This feature is a shortcut of ``'*NP"..." OR *NP"..." OR ...'``.
  For example, we can use ``*NPP`` instead of the expression that execute mulitiple
  ``*NP`` with ``query`` as below.

  ```
  query ("title * 10 || content",
         "*NP"a 1 x" OR
          *NP"a 1 y" OR
          *NP"a 1 z" OR
          *NP"a 2 x" OR
          *NP"a 2 y" OR
          *NP"a 2 z" OR
          *NP"a 3 x" OR
          *NP"a 3 y" OR
          *NP"a 3 z" OR
          *NP"b 1 x" OR
          *NP"b 1 y" OR
          *NP"b 1 z" OR
          *NP"b 2 x" OR
          *NP"b 2 y" OR
          *NP"b 2 z" OR
          *NP"b 3 x" OR
          *NP"b 3 y" OR
          *NP"b 3 z"")
  ```

  We can be written as ``*NPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"`` the above expression by this feature.
  In addition, ``*NPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"`` is faster than ``'*NP"..." OR *NP"..." OR ...'``.

  ```
  query ("title * 10 || content",
         "*NPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"")
  ```

  We implements this feature for improving performance near phrase search
  like ``'*NP"..." OR *NP"..." OR ...'``.

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for order near phrase product search.

  This feature is a shortcut of ``'*ONP"..." OR *ONP"..." OR ...'``.
  For example, we can use ``*ONPP`` instead of the expression that execute multiple
  ``*ONP`` with ``query`` as below.

  ```
  query ("title * 10 || content",
          "*ONP"a 1 x" OR
           *ONP"a 1 y" OR
           *ONP"a 1 z" OR
           *ONP"a 2 x" OR
           *ONP"a 2 y" OR
           *ONP"a 2 z" OR
           *ONP"a 3 x" OR
           *ONP"a 3 y" OR
           *ONP"a 3 z" OR
           *ONP"b 1 x" OR
           *ONP"b 1 y" OR
           *ONP"b 1 z" OR
           *ONP"b 2 x" OR
           *ONP"b 2 y" OR
           *ONP"b 2 z" OR
           *ONP"b 3 x" OR
           *ONP"b 3 y" OR
           *ONP"b 3 z"")
  ```

  We can be written as ``*ONPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"`` the above expression by this feature.
  In addition, ``*ONPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"`` is faster than ``'*ONP"..." OR *ONP"..." OR ...'``.

  ```
  query ("title * 10 || content",
         "*ONPP"(a b) (1 2 3) (x y z)"")
  ```

  We implements this feature for improving performance near phrase search
  like ``'*ONP"..." OR *ONP"..." OR ...'``.

* [request_cancel](/docs/reference/commands/request_cancel.html) Groonga became easily detects ``request_cancel`` while executing a search.

  Because we added more checks of return code to detect ``request_cancel``.

* [thread_dump](/docs/reference/commands/thread_dump.html) Added a new command ``thread_dump``

  Currently, this command works only on Windows.

  We can put a backtrace of all threads into a log as logs of NOTICE level
  at the time of running this command.

  This feature is useful when we solve a problem such as Groonga doesn't return a response.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html) Dropped support for CentOS 8.

  Because CentOS 8 will reach EOL at 2021-12-31.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that we can't remove a index column with invalid parameter.

  * For example, we can't remove a table when we create an invalid index column with ``column_create`` as below.

    ```
    table_create Statuses TABLE_NO_KEY
    column_create Statuses start_time COLUMN_SCALAR UInt16
    column_create Statuses end_time COLUMN_SCALAR UInt16

    table_create Times TABLE_PAT_KEY UInt16
    column_create Times statuses COLUMN_INDEX Statuses start_time,end_time

            ]
          ]
        ],
        false
      ]
    ```

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.
