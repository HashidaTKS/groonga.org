h2. Groonga 1.2.9 has been released

"Groonga 1.2.9":/docs/news.html#release-1-2-9 has been released!

How to install:: "Install":/docs/install.html

The "characteristics of groonga page":/docs/characteristic.html is updated. Please check it out again if you already know groonga. You may find a new characteristic.

h3. MessagePack support

Groonga supports JSON, XML, TSV output format. Since this release, groonga also support MessagePack output format. (NOTE: Only major commands are supported. There are some minor commands are not supported yet.)

If you have a problem with JSON (e.g. JSON requires large ammount data size, long parse time and so on.), please try MessagePack output. Here is an example to use MessgaePack output with HTTP interface. You just add ".msgpack" extension to path.

<pre>
http://localhost:10041/d/select.msgpack?...
</pre>

You can use "--output_type msgpack" for command line interface or gqtp interface.

<pre>
select --output_type msgpack ...
</pre>

h3. A throughput chart on administration page is added

You can use groonga administration page at http://localhost:10041/ when you run groonga as a HTTP server. A real-time throughput chart has been added to the page.

It will be useful when you use groonga with HTTP interface and want to knwo "the current throughput". If you want to know the past througupht, it will not be useful because the chart doesn't keep the past data. You should use other service managerment tool or statistics visualization tool.

Groonga also provides a Munin plugin, groonga_throughput, that generates throughput data of groonga. It supports both HTTP interface and gqtp interface.

h3. Mass delete

You could only delete a record by a delete command. Since this release, you can delete some records that matches specified condition by a delete command. You can use "--filter" option for specifying condition on delete command. It uses the same syntax of "--filter" option of select command. Here is an example to delete records that has "deleted=true" column value from "users" table.

<pre>
delete users --filter 'deleted == true'
</pre>
