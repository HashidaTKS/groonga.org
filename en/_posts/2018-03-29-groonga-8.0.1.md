How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

  * [[log](/docs/reference/log.html)] Show ``filter`` conditions in query log.

  stage dynamic columns.
  * [[logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html#post-filter)] Added a new filter timing.
  * [[logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html#post-filter)] Added a new filter timing.

  * Fixed memory leak that occurs when a prefix query doesn't match any token.
  * Fixed a bug that a cache for different databases is used when multiple databases are opened in the same process.
  * Fixed a bug that a constant value can overflow or underflow in comparison (>,>=,<,<=,==,!=).

### [[log](/docs/reference/log.html)] Show ``filter`` conditions in query log.

As a result, under what conditions you can see how many records were narrowed down.
Specifically, below.

```text
2018-02-15 19:04:02.303809|0x7ffd9eedf6f0|:000000013837058 filter(17): product equal "test_product"
```

In the above example, we can 17 records were narrowed down by `product == "test_product"`.
It's disabled by default. To enable it, you need to set an environment variable below.

```
GRN_QUERY_LOG_SHOW_CONDITION=yes
```

### [[logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html)] Support `filtered` stage dynamic columns.

[logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html) is only support `initial` stage dynamic columns until now.
You can use `filtered` stage dynamic columns in [logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html) also from this release.

### [[logical_count](/docs/reference/commands/logical_count.html#post-filter)][[logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html#post-filter)] Added a new filter timing.

It's executed after filtered stage generated columns are generated.
Specifically, below.

```text
logical_select \
    --logical_table Entries \
    --shard_key created_at \
    --columns[n_likes_sum_per_tag].stage filtered \
    --columns[n_likes_sum_per_tag].type UInt32 \
    --columns[n_likes_sum_per_tag].value 'window_sum(n_likes)' \
    --columns[n_likes_sum_per_tag].window.group_keys 'tag' \
    --filter 'content @ "system" || content @ "use"' \
    --post_filter 'n_likes_sum_per_tag > 10' \
    --output_columns _key,n_likes,n_likes_sum_per_tag

  #       [
  #         [
  #           "_key", 
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ], 
  #         [
  #           "n_likes", 
  #           "UInt32"
  #         ], 
  #         [
  #           "n_likes_sum_per_tag", 
  #           "UInt32"
  #         ]
  #       ]
  #       [
  #         "Groonga", 
  #         10, 
  #         25
  #       ], 
  #       [
  #         "Mroonga", 
  #         15, 
  #         25
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #   ]
  # ]
```

This feature's point that after `filtered` stage generated columns use in `--post_filter`.
In the above example is `logical_select`'example, however it's available on the `logical_count` as well.

### [[logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html)] Optimize window function for large result set.

If we find enough matched records, we don't apply window function to the remaining windows.
Disable this optimization for small result set if its overhead is not negligible.

### [[select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html)] Added `--match_escalation` parameter.`

You can force to enable match escalation by ``--match_escalation yes``.
It's stronger than ``--match_escalation_threshold 99999....999`` because ``--match_escalation yes`` also works with ``SOME_CONDITIONS && column @ 'query'``.
``--match_escalation_threshold`` isn't used in this case.

The default is ``--match_escalation auto``. It doesn't change the current behavior.

You can disable match escalation by ``--match_escalation no``.
It's the same as ``--match_escalation_threshold -1``.

### Fixed memory leak that occurs when a prefix query doesn't match any token.

Fixed a memory leak that occurs when a prefix query doesn't match any token by fuzzy search as below example.

```
table_create Users TABLE_NO_KEY
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
column_create Users name COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
table_create Names TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
column_create Names user COLUMN_INDEX Users name
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
load --table Users
[
{"name": "Tom"},
{"name": "Tomy"},
{"name": "Pom"},
{"name": "Tom"}
]
[[0,0.0,0.0],4]
select Users --filter 'fuzzy_search(name, "Atom", {"prefix_length": 1})'   --output_columns 'name, _score'   --match_escalation_threshold -1
[[0,0.0,0.0],[[[0],[["name","ShortText"],["_score","Int32"]]]]]
```

### Fixed a bug that a cache for different databases is used when multiple databases are opened in the same process.

Fixed a bug that when multiple databases are opened in the same process, results are returned from the cache of another database because the cache was shared within the process.

### Fixed a bug that a constant value can overflow or underflow in comparison (>,>=,<,<=,==,!=).

Fixed a bug that a constant value can overflow or underflow in comparison as below example.

```
table_create Values TABLE_NO_KEY
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
column_create Values number COLUMN_SCALAR Int16
[[0,0.0,0.0],true]
load --table Values
[
{"number": 3},
{"number": 4},
{"number": -1}
]
[[0,0.0,0.0],3]
select Values   --filter 'number > 32768'   --output_columns 'number'
[[0,1522305525.361629,0.0003235340118408203],[[[3],[["number","Int16"]],[3],[4],[-1]]]]
```

An overflow occurs, because of `32768` is over the range of Int16 (-32,768 to 32,767).
As this time `number> 32768` was evaluated as` number> - 32768`.
In this release, when overflow or underflow occurs as above, not to return any results.
