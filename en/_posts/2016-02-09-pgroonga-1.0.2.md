## PGroonga 1.0.2 has been released

[PGroonga](http://pgroonga.github.io/) (píːzí:lúnɡά) 1.0.2 has been released!

See [PGroonga 1.0.0 release announce]({% post_url en/2015-10-29-pgroonga-1.0.0 %}) about PGroonga.

## Changes

Here are changes since 1.0.1:

  * Required Groonga 5.1.2 or later.
  * [[Windows](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/windows.html)] Upgraded base PostgreSQL to 9.5.0 from 9.4.5.
  * [Windows] Upgraded bundled Groonga to 5.1.2.
  * [Windows] Enabled mruby.
  * [[RPM](https://pgroonga.github.io/install/centos.html)] Supported PostgreSQL 9.5.
  * [[jsonb](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/jsonb.html)] Supported sequential scan.
  * Added `pgroonga.text_full_text_search_ops_v2` operator class. It's an experimental operator class. It may break backward compatibility but includes new features.
    Here are supported operators:
    * `LIKE`
    * `ILIKE`
    * `&@`: It's equal to `%%` in `pgroonga.text_full_text_search`.
    * `&?`: It's equal to `@@` in `pgroonga.text_full_text_search`.
    * `&@>`: It returns true when one of the right hand side texts returns true by `&@`.
    * `&?>`: It returns true when one of the right hand side texts returns true by `&?`.
  * Support composite primary key.
  * Fixed a bug that valid tables and columns are removed by `VACUUM` or `ANALYZE`. It's caused after you use `REINDEX`.
