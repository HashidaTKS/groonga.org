## Groonga 10.0.6 has been released

[Groonga 10.0.6](/docs/news.html#release-10-0-6) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [logical_range_filter](/docs/reference/commands/logical_range_filter.html) Improved search plan for large data.

  * Normally, ``logical_range_filter`` is faster than ``logical_select``.
    However, it had been slower than ``logical_select`` in the below case.

    * If Groonga can't get the number of required records easily, it has the feature that switches index search from sequential search.
      * Normally, ``logical_range_filter`` uses a sequential search when records of search target are many.

    * The search process for it is almost the same as ``logical_select`` if the above switching occurred.
    * So, ``logical_range_filter`` is severalfold slower than ``logical_select`` in the above case if the search target is large data. Because ``logical_range_filter`` executes sort after the search.

  * If we search for large data, Groonga easily use sequential search than until now since this release.
  * Therefore, ``logical_range_filter`` will improve performance. Because the case of the search process almost the same as ``logical_select`` decreases.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.1.

* Modify how to install into Debian GNU/Linux.

  * We modify to use ``groonga-apt-source`` instead of ``groonga-archive-keyring``.
  * Because the ``lintian`` command recommends using ``apt-source`` if a package that it puts files under the ``/etc/apt/sources.lists.d/``.

    * The ``lintian`` command is the command which checks for many common packaging errors.
    * Please also refer to the following for the details about installation procedures.

      * [Install Debian GNU/Linux](/docs/install/debian.html)

* [logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html) Added a support for ``highlight_html`` and ``highlight_full``.

* Added support for recycling the IDs of records that are deleted when an array without value space delete.

  * If an array that doesn't have value space is deleted, deleted IDs are never recycled.
  * Groonga had used large storage space by large ID. Because it uses large storage space by itself.

    * For example, large ID is caused after many adds and deletes like Mroonga's ``mroonga_operations``

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Improved performance of full-text-search without index.

* [function](/docs/reference/function.html) Improved performance for calling of function that all arguments a variable reference or literal.

* [indexing](/docs/reference/indexing.html) Improved performance of offline index construction by using token column.

* Improved performance for ``"_score = func(...)"``.

  * The performance when the ``_score`` value calculate by using only function like ``"_score = func(...)"`` improved.

* Fixed a bug that garbage may be included in response after response send error.

  * It may occur if a client didn't read all responses and closed the connection.

### [logical_select](/docs/reference/commands/logical_select.html) Added a support for ``highlight_html``.

  * ``highlight_html`` and ``highlight_full`` can be used in only ``--output-columns`` in ``select`` until now.

  * They can be also used in ``logical_select`` since this release as below.
