How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

There are some small improvements and fixes in the release like the following:

  * Fixed a bug that [groonga-httpd (a nginx based HTTP server implementation)](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.html) doesn't send back a response when response body is empty.
  * Changed the default language of administration panel on Web browser.
  * Really supported weight reference vector column. (It didn't worked well in the previous release.)
