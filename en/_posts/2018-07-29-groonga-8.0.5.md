### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [[time_classify_day_of_week()](/docs/reference/functions/time_classify_day_of_week)] Added a new function `time_classify_day_of_week()`
* Added a new function `time_format_iso8601()`

#### Added a new function `time_classify_day_of_week()`

Now a new feature is landed to get the day of week from time information of each search result.
A new function `time_classify_day_of_week()` which accept an `time` value as its only one parameter, will return the day of week from the given `time` value.
It returns a `UInt8` value, `0` means Sunday and `6` means Saturday.

Before using the function, you need to register `functions/time` plugin at first, via a command line like:

```
plugin_register functions/time
```

#### Added a new function `time_format_iso8601()`

Now you can get any `time` value formatted in the ISO 8601 form.
A new function `time_format_iso8601()` which accept an `time` value as its only one parameter, will return a string formatted in the ISO 8601 form, like `2018-07-29T23:59:59.999999+09:00`.

Same as the previous one, you need to register `functions/time` plugin to use this function.
