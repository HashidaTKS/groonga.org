    * [`request_cancel`](/docs/reference/commands/request_cancel.html) command is added
  * Bug fixes
    * Fixed a crash bug when many indexed values are deleted

There is a incompatible change. It will not cause any problems for many users but please check it before you upgrade Groonga.

There is a bug fix for a crash bug. If you have a crash bug problem when you delete many records at once, please upgrade Groonga.

[`groonga-httpd`](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.html) is marked as stable because some users reports that "it works well".

#### Incompatible change - Database permission is changed to `0644` from  `0666`

Permission of newly create files is changed to `0644` (owner only writable) from `0666` (world writable) when `umask` is `0`.

If you use `groonga` command for Groonga server, you don't have no effect by the change.

If you use [`groonga-httpd`](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.html) in daemon mode, you may have effect by the change. Database created by `groonga-httpd` can be writable only from owner.

This change is incompatible change but it is done because it's related security.

#### Improvement - [`TokenFilterStem`](/docs/reference/token_filters.html#token-filter-stem) can work with MySQL compatible normalizers

`TokenFilterStem` supports a term that is normalized to upper case.

By this change, MySQL compatible normalizers can be worked with `ToeknFilterStem`. Because MySQL compatible normalizers use upper case for normalization.

#### Improvement - [`truncate`](/docs/reference/commands/truncate.html) command supports column

You can use `truncate` command to truncate all values in column.

#### Improvement - [`clearlock`](/docs/reference/commands/clearlock.html) command is renamed to [lock_clear](/docs/reference/commands/lock_clear.html) command

`clearlock` command is renamed to `lock_clear` command. `clearlock` command still works but it's deprecated. Use `lock_clear` for newly written code.

Why do we change its name? It's consistency.

Groonga's commands use `#{CATEGORY}_#{OPERATION}` naming rule. For example, `table_create` is a `table` category command and does `create` operation.

#### Experimental improvement - [`grndb`](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) executable file is added

`grndb` executable file manages Groonga database.

`grndb` provides the following features:

  * Checks whether database is broken or not
  * Recovers broken database

See [grndb document](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) f

#### Experimental improvement - [`request_cancel`](/docs/reference/commands/request_cancel.html) command is added

`request_cancel` command cancel a running request.

`request_cancel` command has some limitations. See [`request_cancel` document](/docs/reference/commands/request_cancel.html) for details

#### Bug fix - Fixed a crash bug when many indexed values are deleted

If you have a crash bug problem when you delete many records at once, please upgrade Groonga.
