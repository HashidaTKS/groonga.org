### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for casting a string like as "[int, int,...]" to a vector of integer like as [int, int,...].

  For example, Groonga handle as a vector of integer like as [1, -2] even if we load vector of string like as "[1, -2]" as below.

    ```
    table_create Data TABLE_NO_KEY
    column_create Data numbers COLUMN_VECTOR Int16
    table_create Numbers TABLE_PAT_KEY Int16
    column_create Numbers data_numbers COLUMN_INDEX Data numbers

    load --table Data
    [
    {"numbers": "[1, -2]"},
    {"numbers": "[-3, 4]"}
    ]

    dump   --dump_plugins no   --dump_schema no
    load --table Data
    [
    ["_id","numbers"],
    [1,[1,-2]],
    [2,[-3,4]]
    ]

    column_create Numbers data_numbers COLUMN_INDEX Data numbers
    select Data --filter 'numbers @ -2'
    [[0,0.0,0.0],[[[1],[["_id","UInt32"],["numbers","Int16"]],[1,[1,-2]]]]]
    ```

  This feature supports for the floowings types.

    * Int8
    * UInt8
    * Int16
    * UInt16
    * Int32
    * UInt32
    * Int64
    * UInt64

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for loading a JSON array expressed as a text string as a vector of string.

  For example, Groonga handle as a vector that has two elements like as ["hello", "world"] if we load JSON array expressed as a text string like as "[\"hello\", \"world\"]" as below.

    ```
    table_create Data TABLE_NO_KEY
    [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
    column_create Data strings COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
    [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
    table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText   --normalizer NormalizerNFKC130   --default_tokenizer TokenNgram
    [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
    column_create Terms data_strings COLUMN_INDEX Data strings
    [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
    load --table Data
    [
    {"strings": "[\"Hello\", \"World\"]"},
    {"strings": "[\"Good-bye\", \"World\"]"}
    ]
    [[0,0.0,0.0],2]
    dump   --dump_plugins no   --dump_schema no
    load --table Data
    [
    ["_id","strings"],
    [1,["Hello","World"]],
    [2,["Good-bye","World"]]
    ]

    column_create Terms data_strings COLUMN_INDEX Data strings
    select Data --filter 'strings @ "bye"'
    [
      [
        0,
        0.0,
        0.0
      ],
      [
        [
          [
            1
          ],
          [
            [
              "_id",
              "UInt32"
            ],
            [
              "strings",
              "ShortText"
            ]
          ],
          [
            2,
            [
              "Good-bye",
              "World"
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
    ```

  In before version, Groonga handled as a vector that had one element like as ["[\"hello\", \"world\"]"] if we loaded JSON array expressed as a text string like as "[\"hello\", \"world\"]".

* [Documentation] Added a documentation about the following items.

  * [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html) Added a documentation about ``WEIGHT_FLOAT32`` flag.

  * [NormalizerNFKC121](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_nfkc121.html) Added a documentation about ``NormalizerNFKC121``.

  * [NormalizerNFKC130](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_nfkc130.html) Added a documentation about ``NormalizerNFKC130``.

  * [NormalizerTable](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_table.html) Added a documentation about ``NormalizerTable``.

* Updated to 3.0.0 that the version of Apache Arrow that Groonga requires.

### Fixes

* Fixed a memory leak when we created a table with a tokenizer with invalid option.

* Fixed a bug that may not add a new entry in Hash table.

  This bug occurs in Groonga 11.0.6, and it may occur if we quite a lot of add and delete data.

* Fixed a resource leak when Groonga fail open a new file caused by out of memory.

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.
