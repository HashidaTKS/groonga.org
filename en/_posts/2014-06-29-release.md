## Groonga 4.0.3 has been released

[Groonga 4.0.3](/docs/news.html#release-4-0-3) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are new features in the release:

  * [Groonga HTTP server (an implementation that doesn't use nginx)](/docs/reference/executables/groonga-server-http.html) supports POST.
  * Improved plugin API.

#### Groonga HTTP server supports POST

Groonga HTTP server that can be ran by `groonga --protocol http` doesn't support POST. So you can't [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) large data.

In this release, Groonga HTTP server supports POST as an experimental feature. It also supports `"Expect: 100-Continue"` HTTP header. So you will be able to use curl to send POST request.

If you get a problem for the feature, please report it.

If the feature works well, please report it. It is better that the report includes "how large data" and "how to send your request". If many users sends "success reports", we mark the feature as a stable feature.

#### Improved plugin API

We are working on improving plugin API. You will be able to write your Groonga plugin easily in near future.

### Conclusion

See [Release 4.0.3 2014/06/29](/docs/news.html#release-4-0-3) about detailed changes since 4.0.2.
