## Groonga 6.1.4 has been released!

[Groonga 6.1.4](/docs/news.html#release-6-1-4) has been released.

How to install in each environment: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

It's a bug fix release of 6.1.3. It's recommend that Groonga 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 users upgrade to 6.1.4.

This release fixes an index search bug that index search may not return records that should be matched. This bug doesn't break index. You don't need to rebuild your indexes.

If you can't upgrade to 6.1.3, set the following environment variable:

```text
GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE=no
```

This is a workaround of this bug.

This release includes an improvements for index update performance. This isn't effective for normal use cases. This is effective for multiple column index for [Mroonga](http://mroonga.org/). If you're using Mroonga's multiple column index, try this release.

### Conclusions

Once again, we recommend that Groonga 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 users upgrade to 6.1.4.

Please refer to [Release 6.1.4](/docs/news.html#release-6-1-4) about detailed changes since 6.1.3.

Then, let's go all out to search by Groonga!
