## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 2.4.2 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 2.4.2 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

If you are new user, see also [About PGroonga]({% post_url /2017-10-10-pgroonga-2.0.2 %}#pgroonga).

## Highlight

### Added a new module ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` for executing ``pgroonga_wal_apply()`` and ``pgroonga_vacuum()`` automatically on a standby database

  Normally PGroonga's WAL doesn't t apply on a standby database, if we use PGroonga with streaming replication.

  Therefore, for example, a first "SELECT" on a primary database may become slower after we switch from a standby database. Because it takes time to apply PGroonga's WAL to the primary database.

  Until now, we could solve this problem with the ``pgroonga_wal_applier`` module. However we should use ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module since 2.4.2.
  the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module is more useful than the ``pgroonga_wal_applier`` module. Because ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` does not only execute automatically the ``pgroonga_vacuum()`` function but also execute automatically the ``pgroonga_wal_apply()`` function on a standby database.

  Therefore, if we use the pgroonga_standby_maintainer module, we don't need to use the pgroonga_wal_applier module and we don't need to execute periodically the pgroonga_vacuum() function on the standby database.

  Please refer to [a reference of the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/modules/pgroonga-standby-maintainer.html) about how to the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module.

### [The `pgroonga_snippet_html` function] Added a new argument for specifing snippet length dynamically

  Normally, the max number of around texts of keywords that ``pgroonga_snippet_html`` function can extracts is 200. However, we can adjust this number dynamically with this feature.
  Therefore, we can extract around texts of keywords with increased flexibility.

  For example, if we want to extruct 50 byte around texts of keywords, we can extruct them as below with this feature.
  Note that We can dynamically specify a length of around texts of keywords with the third argument of the ``pgroonga_snippet_html()`` function.

  ```sql
  SELECT pgroonga_snippet_html(
    'Groonga is a fast and accurate full text search engine based on ' ||
    'inverted index. One of the characteristics of Groonga is that a ' ||
    'newly registered document instantly appears in search results. ' ||
    'Also, Groonga allows updates without read locks. These characteristics ' ||
    'result in superior performance on real-time applications.' ||
    E'\n' ||
    E'\n' ||
    'Groonga is also a column-oriented database management system (DBMS). ' ||
    'Compared with well-known row-oriented systems, such as MySQL and ' ||
    'PostgreSQL, column-oriented systems are more suited for aggregate ' ||
    'queries. Due to this advantage, Groonga can cover weakness of ' ||
    'row-oriented systems.',
    ARRAY['Groonga'],
    50
  );
                                                                                                                    pgroonga_snippet_html
